      Contains standardized clinical codes from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)  used to identify patients who are eligible for flu vaccination based on clinical  risk factors. These codes cover various clinical conditions, chronic diseases,  procedures, and medication classes that indicate increased flu vaccination priority  according to national health guidelines.

      The codes are organized into logical groups (e.g., respiratory conditions,  cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised states) and include both SNOMED CT  codes and system-specific mappings for EMIS and TPP clinical systems.'
