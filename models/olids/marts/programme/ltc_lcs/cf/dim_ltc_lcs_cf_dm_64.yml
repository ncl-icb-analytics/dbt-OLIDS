    description: 'Case finding for diabetes screening in patients with high BMI using ethnicity-specific thresholds.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies patients with high BMI requiring diabetes screening (BAME: ≥32.5, non-BAME: ≥35)

      • Targets patients lacking HbA1c assessment in the last 24 months

      • Uses ethnicity-specific BMI thresholds for appropriate diabetes risk assessment

      • One row per eligible person with BMI, ethnicity data, and HbA1c monitoring gap'
