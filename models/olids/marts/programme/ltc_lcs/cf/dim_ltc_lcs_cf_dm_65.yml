    description: 'Case finding for diabetes screening in patients with moderate-high BMI using ethnicity-specific thresholds.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies patients with moderate BMI requiring diabetes screening (BAME: 27.5-32.5, non-BAME: 30-35)

      • Targets patients lacking HbA1c assessment in the last 24 months

      • Uses ethnicity-specific BMI thresholds recognising different diabetes risk profiles

      • One row per eligible person with BMI, ethnicity data, and HbA1c monitoring gap'
