    description: 'Case finding for stage 1 hypertension without cardiovascular risk factors.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies patients with stage 1 hypertension (clinic BP 140-159/90-99, home/ABPM 135-149/85-94)

      • Excludes patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors or complications

      • Targets patients suitable for lifestyle intervention rather than immediate drug treatment

      • One row per eligible person with latest blood pressure readings and risk factor status'
