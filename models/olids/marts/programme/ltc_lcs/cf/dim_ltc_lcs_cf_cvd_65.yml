    description: 'Case finding for patients with moderate cardiovascular risk requiring moderate-dose statin therapy.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies patients with latest QRISK2 score ≥10% requiring moderate-dose statin therapy

      • Targets primary prevention patients needing evidence-based lipid management

      • Uses QRISK2-based cardiovascular risk stratification for statin eligibility decisions

      • One row per person meeting moderate cardiovascular risk intervention thresholds'
