    description: 'Case finding for patients with significantly elevated single UACR reading indicating substantial kidney damage.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies patients aged 17+ with latest UACR reading > 70 (excludes patients from CKD_62)

      • Targets patients with severe proteinuria requiring immediate clinical attention and nephrology referral

      • Takes maximum UACR value per day to handle multiple readings on same date

      • One row per person with clinically significant single elevated UACR reading'
