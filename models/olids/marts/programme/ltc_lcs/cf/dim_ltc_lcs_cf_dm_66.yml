    description: 'Case finding for patients with pre-diabetic HbA1c levels requiring continued surveillance.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies patients with latest HbA1c between 42-46 mmol/mol (pre-diabetic range)

      • Requires HbA1c assessment within the last 12 months for current status

      • Targets patients for diabetes prevention interventions and ongoing monitoring

      • One row per eligible person with recent HbA1c results and monitoring history'
