    description: 'Historical Person Demographics Dimension Table (Type 2 SCD)

      Provides person demographics with temporal context using modern Type 2 slowly changing dimensions approach.
      Much more efficient than person-month grain - only creates new rows when demographics actually change.

      
      Key Features:

      • Type 2 SCD with effective_start_date and effective_end_date (NULL = current period)

      • 5-year rolling history window for performance optimisation

      • Modern SCD2 implementation without sentinel dates (no 9999-12-31 values)

      • Temporal tracking for: age progression, practice registration, address changes, ethnicity updates

      • Static tracking for: sex, language, interpreter needs (assumed stable)

      • Efficient storage - periods created only when demographics change, not monthly

      
      Implementation Notes:

      • Uses NULL effective_end_date for current periods (not sentinel dates)

      • Limited to last 5 years of data to balance completeness with performance

      • Change points triggered by: practice moves, address changes, age milestones, ethnicity recordings

      For analysis queries, join using:
      WHERE analysis_date >= effective_start_date AND (effective_end_date IS NULL OR analysis_date < effective_end_date)'
