    **Foot Check Completion Logic:**\n- Check completed in last 12 months if:\n  1. Check date within 12 months AND\n  2.\
    \ Either both feet checked OR unchecked foot is absent/amputated AND\n  3. Check not declined or unsuitable\n\n**Permanent\
    \ Exemption:**\n- Patient permanently exempt only if both feet are absent/amputated\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Tracks\
    \ individual foot risk levels (Low, Moderate, High)\n- Records foot absence (congenital) vs amputation\n- Includes Townson\
    \ scale levels when applicable\n\n**Clinical Context:**\nPart of diabetes 8/9 care processes. Critical for preventing\
    \ diabetic foot complications\nand ulcerations through regular screening and risk stratification.\n\n**Business Rules:**\n\
    - Base population: People on diabetes register\n- Uses latest foot examination data\n- Comprehensive status tracking including\
    \ partial checks\n- Supports clinical decision-making for foot care pathways\n"
