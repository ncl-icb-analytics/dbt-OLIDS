    description: 'Eligibility assessment and due status for NHS Health Check programme.


      Business Logic:

      • Determines eligibility based on age 40-74 and absence of excluding chronic conditions

      • Checks for excluding conditions: CHD, diabetes, stroke, CKD, AF, heart failure, familial hypercholesterolaemia

      • Calculates due status: eligible patients who never had a check or last check >5 years ago (1825 days)

      • One row per person with eligibility flags and latest health check date'
