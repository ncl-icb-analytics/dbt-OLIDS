        "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Mart: Valproate Database Scope - Defines cohort of non-male individuals aged 0-55 with recent valproate prescriptions requiring safety monitoring.

Business Purpose:
â€¢ Support valproate safety monitoring programme by defining target population for regulatory compliance
â€¢ Enable systematic identification of patients requiring valproate-related safety interventions
â€¢ Provide clinical decision support for valproate prescribing safety in reproductive-age populations
â€¢ Support quality improvement initiatives for medication safety and teratogenicity risk management

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per non-male person aged 0-55 with valproate prescription in last 6 months
â€¢ Includes most recent valproate prescription details and patient demographics
â€¢ Limited to target population requiring valproate safety monitoring and intervention

Key Features:
â€¢ Age and gender-based cohort definition (non-male, 0-55 years) for appropriate safety monitoring
â€¢ Recent prescription tracking (6 months) for current valproate therapy identification
â€¢ Evidence-based cohort criteria supporting regulatory compliance and patient safety
â€¢ Integration with valproate safety monitoring pathways for systematic patient management
