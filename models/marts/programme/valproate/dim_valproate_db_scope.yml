    description: 'Dashboard scope table - every row should be included in the valproate monitoring dashboard.


      Business Logic:

      • Joins child-bearing age cohort (non-male, 0-55 years) with recent valproate prescriptions (last 6 months)

      • One row per person with their most recent valproate prescription details

      • Only includes patients meeting both criteria: correct age/gender AND recent valproate therapy'
