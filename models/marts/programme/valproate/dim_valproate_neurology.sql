        "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Mart: Valproate Neurology Status - Person-level aggregation of neurology-related events for valproate therapy monitoring and specialist care coordination.

Business Purpose:
â€¢ Support valproate safety monitoring through neurology specialist engagement tracking and care coordination
â€¢ Enable systematic monitoring of neurological care requirements for valproate therapy management
â€¢ Provide clinical decision support for neurology specialist involvement and treatment oversight
â€¢ Support quality improvement initiatives for comprehensive neurological care and medication safety

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per person with neurology-related events in valproate therapy monitoring
â€¢ Aggregates all neurology events with earliest and latest specialist engagement tracking
â€¢ Includes comprehensive neurology care history for specialist coordination assessment

Key Features:
â€¢ Person-level neurology event aggregation with complete specialist care history
â€¢ Earliest and latest neurology engagement tracking for monitoring care coordination effectiveness
â€¢ Evidence-based neurology care assessment supporting comprehensive valproate therapy management
â€¢ Integration with neurology care pathways for systematic specialist engagement and monitoring
