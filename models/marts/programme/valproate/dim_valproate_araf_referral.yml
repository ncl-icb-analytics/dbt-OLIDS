    description: 'Person-level aggregation of ARAF referral events for valproate monitoring.


      Business Logic:

      • Aggregates all ARAF referral events per person from intermediate ARAF referral events table

      • Provides earliest and latest ARAF referral event dates for timeline analysis

      • Includes arrays of all observation IDs, concept codes, and displays for traceability

      • Only includes people who have ARAF referral events (has_araf_referral_event always TRUE)'
