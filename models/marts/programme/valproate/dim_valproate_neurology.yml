    description: 'Person-level aggregation of neurology-related events for valproate monitoring.


      Business Logic:

      • Aggregates all neurology events per person from intermediate neurology events table

      • Provides earliest and latest neurology event dates for timeline analysis

      • Includes arrays of all observation IDs, concept codes, and displays for traceability

      • Only includes people who have neurology events (has_neurology_event always TRUE)'
