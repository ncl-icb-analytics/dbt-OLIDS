    description: 'Person-level aggregation of psychiatry-related events for valproate monitoring.


      Business Logic:

      • Aggregates all psychiatry events per person from intermediate psychiatry events table

      • Provides earliest and latest psychiatry event dates for timeline analysis

      • Includes arrays of all observation IDs, concept codes, and displays for traceability

      • Only includes people who have psychiatry events (has_psych_event always TRUE)'
