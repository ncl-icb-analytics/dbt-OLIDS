    description: 'Case finding for children and young people with asthma symptoms requiring formal diagnosis.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies children/young people aged 18 months to under 18 years with asthma symptoms but no formal diagnosis

      • Targets paediatric population with clinical indicators suggesting asthma requiring assessment

      • Supports early asthma diagnosis and management to prevent complications

      • One row per eligible child/young person requiring asthma evaluation and formal diagnosis'
