  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding CVD_66 - Identifies patients aged 75-83 requiring QRISK2 assessment for age-appropriate cardiovascular risk management.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for cardiovascular risk assessment in elderly populations (75-83 years)

    • Enable identification of patients requiring age-appropriate cardiovascular risk evaluation

    • Provide clinical decision support for elderly cardiovascular risk management and statin review

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for age-specific cardiovascular prevention programmes


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person aged 75-83 requiring QRISK2 assessment due to lack of recent evaluation

    • Includes age-specific risk assessment requirements and cardiovascular monitoring needs

    • Limited to elderly patients without recent cardiovascular risk evaluation


    Key Features:

    • Age-specific cardiovascular risk assessment (75-83 years) for elderly care optimisation

    • QRISK2 requirement identification for patients lacking recent risk evaluation

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting age-appropriate cardiovascular care

    • Integration with elderly care pathways for comprehensive cardiovascular risk management'
