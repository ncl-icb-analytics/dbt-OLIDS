        "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding HTN_66 - Identifies patients with stage 1 hypertension without cardiovascular risk factors requiring lifestyle intervention focus.

Business Purpose:
â€¢ Support systematic case finding for stage 1 hypertension without additional cardiovascular risk factors
â€¢ Enable lifestyle-focused intervention for patients with isolated stage 1 hypertension
â€¢ Provide clinical decision support for low-risk hypertension management approaches
â€¢ Support quality improvement initiatives for comprehensive hypertension care across risk categories

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per person with stage 1 hypertension without additional cardiovascular risk factors
â€¢ Includes patients suitable for lifestyle intervention rather than immediate pharmacological treatment
â€¢ Limited to patients with isolated stage 1 hypertension requiring monitoring and lifestyle support

Key Features:
â€¢ Stage 1 hypertension identification without cardiovascular risk factor complications
â€¢ Lifestyle intervention focus for patients with lower overall cardiovascular risk
â€¢ Evidence-based case finding supporting risk-stratified hypertension management
â€¢ Integration with lifestyle intervention pathways for comprehensive non-pharmacological care
