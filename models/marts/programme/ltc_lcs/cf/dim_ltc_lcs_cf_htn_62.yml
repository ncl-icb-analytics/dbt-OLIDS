      Business Logic:

      • Identifies patients with stage 2 hypertension (clinic BP 160-179/100-109, home/ABPM 150-164/95-99)

      • Excludes patients already captured in severe hypertension category (HTN_61)

      • Targets patients requiring clinical intervention and cardiovascular risk assessment

      • One row per person with latest blood pressure readings meeting stage 2 criteria'
