  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding HTN_62 - Identifies patients with stage 2 hypertension requiring blood pressure management and cardiovascular risk assessment.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for stage 2 hypertension requiring clinical intervention and management

    • Enable hypertension management and cardiovascular risk reduction in high-risk populations

    • Provide clinical decision support for blood pressure monitoring and treatment optimisation

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for comprehensive hypertension management programmes


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person with latest blood pressure readings meeting stage 2 hypertension criteria

    • Excludes patients already captured in severe hypertension category (HTN_61)

    • Limited to patients requiring stage 2 hypertension intervention and monitoring


    Key Features:

    • Stage 2 hypertension identification with exclusion of severe hypertension cases

    • Latest blood pressure assessment focus for appropriate clinical intervention

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting staged hypertension management protocols

    • Integration with cardiovascular risk management pathways for risk-stratified intervention'
