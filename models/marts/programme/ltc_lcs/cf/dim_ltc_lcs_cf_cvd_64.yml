  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding CVD_64 - Identifies patients requiring high-dose statin therapy for optimal cardiovascular risk management.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for cardiovascular medication optimisation requiring high-dose statin therapy

    • Enable identification of patients needing intensive lipid management for secondary prevention

    • Provide clinical decision support for evidence-based statin dose escalation

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for cardiovascular risk reduction and medication optimisation


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person in cardiovascular base population requiring high-dose statin therapy

    • Includes current statin prescription patterns and cardiovascular risk indicators

    • Limited to patients meeting criteria for intensive lipid management


    Key Features:

    • High-dose statin requirement assessment based on cardiovascular risk profile

    • Current medication pattern analysis for therapeutic optimisation opportunities

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting intensive lipid management protocols

    • Integration with cardiovascular base population for targeted intervention'
