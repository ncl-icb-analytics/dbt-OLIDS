  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding DM_66 - Identifies patients with elevated HbA1c in pre-diabetic range with recent monitoring requiring continued surveillance.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for patients with pre-diabetic HbA1c levels requiring ongoing monitoring

    • Enable continued diabetes surveillance in patients with recent elevated glucose control

    • Provide clinical decision support for diabetes prevention in patients with active monitoring

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for diabetes prevention through enhanced surveillance


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person with latest HbA1c between 42-46 mmol/mol assessed within 12 months

    • Includes patients with pre-diabetic glucose control undergoing active monitoring

    • Limited to patients with recent assessment showing elevated glucose levels


    Key Features:

    • Pre-diabetic HbA1c range identification (42-46 mmol/mol) for active diabetes prevention

    • Recent monitoring confirmation (within 12 months) for current clinical status

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting diabetes prevention in actively monitored populations

    • Integration with diabetes prevention pathways for sustained intervention and monitoring'
