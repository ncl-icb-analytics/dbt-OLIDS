  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding HTN_61 - Identifies patients with severe hypertension requiring urgent blood pressure management and intervention.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for severe hypertension requiring immediate clinical intervention

    • Enable urgent hypertension management and cardiovascular risk reduction in high-risk populations

    • Provide clinical decision support for blood pressure threshold monitoring and treatment escalation

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for hypertension management and cardiovascular disease prevention


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person with latest blood pressure readings meeting severe hypertension criteria

    • Includes patients with systolic or diastolic blood pressure above severe hypertension thresholds

    • Limited to patients requiring urgent blood pressure intervention and management


    Key Features:

    • Severe hypertension identification based on clinical threshold blood pressure measurements

    • Latest blood pressure assessment focus for immediate clinical intervention

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting NICE guidelines for hypertension management

    • Integration with cardiovascular risk management pathways for urgent intervention'
