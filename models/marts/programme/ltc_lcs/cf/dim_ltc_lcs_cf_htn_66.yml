  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding HTN_66 - Identifies patients with stage 1 hypertension without cardiovascular risk factors requiring lifestyle intervention focus.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for stage 1 hypertension without additional cardiovascular risk factors

    • Enable lifestyle-focused intervention for patients with isolated stage 1 hypertension

    • Provide clinical decision support for low-risk hypertension management approaches

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for comprehensive hypertension care across risk categories


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person with stage 1 hypertension without additional cardiovascular risk factors

    • Includes patients suitable for lifestyle intervention rather than immediate pharmacological treatment

    • Limited to patients with isolated stage 1 hypertension requiring monitoring and lifestyle support


    Key Features:

    • Stage 1 hypertension identification without cardiovascular risk factor complications

    • Lifestyle intervention focus for patients with lower overall cardiovascular risk

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting risk-stratified hypertension management

    • Integration with lifestyle intervention pathways for comprehensive non-pharmacological care'
