  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding CVD_63 - Identifies patients on statins with suboptimal cholesterol control requiring medication review.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for cardiovascular medication optimisation in patients on statin therapy

    • Enable identification of patients requiring statin dose adjustment or alternative lipid management

    • Provide clinical decision support for cholesterol management and cardiovascular risk reduction

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for secondary prevention and medication effectiveness monitoring
