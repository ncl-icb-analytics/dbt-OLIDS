        "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding CVD_66 - Identifies patients aged 75-83 requiring QRISK2 assessment for age-appropriate cardiovascular risk management.

Business Purpose:
â€¢ Support systematic case finding for cardiovascular risk assessment in elderly populations (75-83 years)
â€¢ Enable identification of patients requiring age-appropriate cardiovascular risk evaluation
â€¢ Provide clinical decision support for elderly cardiovascular risk management and statin review
â€¢ Support quality improvement initiatives for age-specific cardiovascular prevention programmes

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per person aged 75-83 requiring QRISK2 assessment due to lack of recent evaluation
â€¢ Includes age-specific risk assessment requirements and cardiovascular monitoring needs
â€¢ Limited to elderly patients without recent cardiovascular risk evaluation

Key Features:
â€¢ Age-specific cardiovascular risk assessment (75-83 years) for elderly care optimisation
â€¢ QRISK2 requirement identification for patients lacking recent risk evaluation
â€¢ Evidence-based case finding supporting age-appropriate cardiovascular care
â€¢ Integration with elderly care pathways for comprehensive cardiovascular risk management
