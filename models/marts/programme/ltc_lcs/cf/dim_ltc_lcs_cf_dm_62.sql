Population Scope:
â€¢ Patients aged 17+ from LTC case finding base population
â€¢ Gestational diabetes and pregnancy risk history
â€¢ No HbA1c assessment within 12 months

Key Features:
â€¢ Gestational diabetes history identification
â€¢ HbA1c surveillance gap detection
â€¢ Evidence-based case finding for post-pregnancy diabetes risk management
