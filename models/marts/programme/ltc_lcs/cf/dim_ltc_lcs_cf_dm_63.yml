    description: 'Case finding for patients with borderline HbA1c levels requiring diabetes surveillance.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies patients aged 17+ with latest HbA1c between 46-47 mmol/mol (borderline pre-diabetic)

      • Targets patients lacking recent diabetes monitoring and requiring enhanced surveillance

      • Focuses on borderline glycaemic control requiring ongoing diabetes risk assessment

      • One row per eligible person with borderline HbA1c requiring intervention'
