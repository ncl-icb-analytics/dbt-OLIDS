  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding DM_63 - Identifies patients with borderline HbA1c levels requiring diabetes surveillance and intervention.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for patients with HbA1c in pre-diabetic range requiring ongoing monitoring

    • Enable early intervention for diabetes prevention in patients with borderline glucose control

    • Provide clinical decision support for diabetes surveillance in high-risk populations

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for diabetes prevention and early detection programmes


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person aged 17+ with latest HbA1c between 46-47 mmol/mol lacking recent monitoring

    • Includes patients with borderline glycaemic control requiring enhanced surveillance

    • Limited to patients in pre-diabetic range without recent diabetes assessment


    Key Features:

    • Borderline HbA1c identification (46-47 mmol/mol) for enhanced diabetes surveillance

    • Monitoring gap detection for patients requiring ongoing diabetes risk assessment

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting diabetes prevention in borderline glycaemic populations

    • Integration with diabetes prevention pathways for targeted lifestyle and medical intervention'
