        "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding CVD_64 - Identifies patients requiring high-dose statin therapy for optimal cardiovascular risk management.

Business Purpose:
â€¢ Support systematic case finding for cardiovascular medication optimisation requiring high-dose statin therapy
â€¢ Enable identification of patients needing intensive lipid management for secondary prevention
â€¢ Provide clinical decision support for evidence-based statin dose escalation
â€¢ Support quality improvement initiatives for cardiovascular risk reduction and medication optimisation

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per person in cardiovascular base population requiring high-dose statin therapy
â€¢ Includes current statin prescription patterns and cardiovascular risk indicators
â€¢ Limited to patients meeting criteria for intensive lipid management

Key Features:
â€¢ High-dose statin requirement assessment based on cardiovascular risk profile
â€¢ Current medication pattern analysis for therapeutic optimisation opportunities
â€¢ Evidence-based case finding supporting intensive lipid management protocols
â€¢ Integration with cardiovascular base population for targeted intervention
