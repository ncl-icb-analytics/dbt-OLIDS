  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding HTN_63 - Identifies Black and South Asian patients with cardiovascular risk factors and elevated blood pressure requiring culturally appropriate intervention.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for hypertension in Black and South Asian populations with enhanced cardiovascular risk

    • Enable ethnicity-specific hypertension management aligned with higher cardiovascular risk profiles

    • Provide clinical decision support for culturally appropriate blood pressure management

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for equitable hypertension care and cardiovascular disease prevention


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per Black or South Asian person with elevated blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors

    • Includes ethnicity-specific risk assessment and blood pressure threshold evaluation

    • Limited to patients requiring culturally appropriate hypertension intervention


    Key Features:

    • Ethnicity-specific hypertension case finding for Black and South Asian populations

    • Cardiovascular risk factor integration for comprehensive risk assessment

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting ethnicity-appropriate hypertension management

    • Integration with culturally sensitive cardiovascular risk management pathways'
