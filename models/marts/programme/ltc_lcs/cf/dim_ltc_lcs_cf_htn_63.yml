  description: 'Case finding for hypertension in Black and South Asian patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

    Business Logic:
    
    • Targets Black and South Asian patients with elevated blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors
    
    • Uses ethnicity-specific risk thresholds recognising higher cardiovascular risk in these populations
    
    • Identifies patients requiring culturally appropriate hypertension intervention
    
    • One row per eligible person with ethnicity, BP readings, and risk factor assessment'
