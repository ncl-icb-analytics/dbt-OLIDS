  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding CKD_64 - Identifies patients with specific conditions requiring eGFR monitoring who lack recent kidney function assessment.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for chronic kidney disease in patients with high-risk conditions

    • Enable identification of patients requiring eGFR monitoring based on clinical risk factors

    • Provide clinical decision support for appropriate kidney function surveillance

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for condition-specific CKD prevention and early detection


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person aged 17+ with high-risk conditions but no recent eGFR testing

    • Includes patients with AKI history, BPH/gout, nephrotoxic medications, or microhaematuria

    • Limited to patients lacking eGFR assessment within 12 months


    Key Features:

    • Multi-condition risk assessment (AKI, BPH/gout, lithium/nephrotoxic drugs, microhaematuria)

    • Time-based surveillance monitoring (12-month eGFR testing gap identification)

    • Complex microhaematuria validation with UACR correlation

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting condition-specific kidney function monitoring'
