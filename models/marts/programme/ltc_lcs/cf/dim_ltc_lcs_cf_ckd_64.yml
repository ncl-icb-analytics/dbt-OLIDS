    description: 'Case finding for patients with specific conditions requiring eGFR monitoring who lack recent kidney function assessment.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies patients aged 17+ with high-risk conditions but no eGFR test in last 12 months

      • Targets patients with AKI (last 3 years), BPH/gout, lithium/nephrotoxic medications (last 6 months), or validated microhaematuria

      • Uses complex microhaematuria validation with UACR correlation and negative urine test exclusion

      • One row per person meeting specific condition criteria without recent eGFR monitoring'
