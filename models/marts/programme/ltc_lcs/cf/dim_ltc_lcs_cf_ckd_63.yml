  description: 'Case finding for patients with significantly elevated single UACR reading indicating substantial kidney damage.

    Business Logic:

    • Identifies patients aged 17+ with latest UACR reading > 70 (excludes patients from CKD_62)

    • Targets patients with severe proteinuria requiring immediate clinical attention and nephrology referral

    • Takes maximum UACR value per day to handle multiple readings on same date

    • One row per person with clinically significant single elevated UACR reading'
