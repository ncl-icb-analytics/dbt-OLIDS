  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding CKD_63 - Identifies patients with significantly elevated single UACR reading indicating substantial kidney damage.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for undiagnosed chronic kidney disease through single high UACR assessment

    • Enable identification of patients with severe proteinuria requiring immediate clinical attention

    • Provide clinical decision support for urgent nephrology referral and intervention

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for comprehensive kidney damage detection


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person aged 17+ with latest UACR reading above 70

    • Excludes patients already captured in consecutive high UACR cohort (CKD_62)

    • Limited to patients with clinically significant single elevated readings


    Key Features:

    • High-threshold UACR assessment (>70) for significant kidney damage identification

    • Exclusion logic to prevent double-counting with consecutive reading cohorts

    • Latest assessment focus for immediate clinical intervention priority

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting urgent clinical review for severe proteinuria'
