  description: 'Case finding for stage 1 hypertension with cardiovascular risk factors.

    Business Logic:
    
    • Identifies patients with stage 1 hypertension who also have cardiovascular risk factors
    
    • Targets higher-risk patients requiring comprehensive management rather than lifestyle-only
    
    • Combines blood pressure thresholds with cardiovascular risk assessment
    
    • One row per eligible person with BP readings and risk factor status'
