  description: 'Mart: LTC LCS Case Finding HTN_65 - Identifies patients with stage 1 hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors requiring comprehensive management.


    Business Purpose:

    • Support systematic case finding for stage 1 hypertension with cardiovascular risk factors requiring intervention

    • Enable risk-stratified hypertension management based on overall cardiovascular risk profile

    • Provide clinical decision support for stage 1 hypertension treatment decisions

    • Support quality improvement initiatives for comprehensive cardiovascular risk management


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person with stage 1 hypertension and additional cardiovascular risk factors

    • Includes patients requiring intervention based on combined hypertension and cardiovascular risk

    • Limited to patients meeting stage 1 hypertension criteria with additional risk factors


    Key Features:

    • Stage 1 hypertension identification with cardiovascular risk factor assessment

    • Risk-stratified approach to hypertension management and intervention

    • Evidence-based case finding supporting risk-based treatment guidelines

    • Integration with cardiovascular risk management pathways for comprehensive care'
