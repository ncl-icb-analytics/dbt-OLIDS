    description: 'Case finding for stage 1 hypertension with cardiovascular risk factors.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies patients with stage 1 hypertension who also have cardiovascular risk factors

      • Targets higher-risk patients requiring comprehensive management rather than lifestyle-only

      • Combines blood pressure thresholds with cardiovascular risk assessment

      • One row per eligible person with BP readings and risk factor status'
