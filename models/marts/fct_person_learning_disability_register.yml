      **Learning Disability Register - QOF Quality Measures**
      
      Pattern 1: Simple Register with age filter.
      
      QOF Business Logic:
      - Learning disability diagnosis (LD_DIAGNOSIS_COD) for age â‰¥14 years
      - No resolution codes (LD is permanent condition)
      - Age restriction: patients must be 14+ years
      - Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) for comprehensive reporting
      
      QOF Context:
      Used for learning disability quality measures including:
      - Learning disability care pathway monitoring
      - Health equity assessment and improvement
      - Special needs service coordination
      - Annual health checks
      
      Matches legacy fct_person_dx_ld business logic and field structure.
