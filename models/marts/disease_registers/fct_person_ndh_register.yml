  description: "QOF Non-Diabetic Hyperglycaemia (NDH) Register - Complex type classification register with diabetes exclusion\
    \ logic.\n\n**Business Logic (Pattern 4):**\n- Age \u226518 years (adult hyperglycaemia monitoring)\n- NDH diagnosis:\
    \ Any of NDH, IGT (Impaired Glucose Tolerance), or PRD (Pre-diabetes) codes\n- Complex diabetes exclusion: Has NDH AND\
    \ (never had diabetes OR diabetes is resolved)\n- Multi-condition tracking: NDH subtypes and diabetes status interaction\n\
    \n**Clinical Context:**\nThis register identifies patients with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia who require monitoring\nand\
    \ lifestyle intervention to prevent progression to Type 2 diabetes. The complex logic\nensures patients are removed from\
    \ the NDH register if they develop diabetes, but can\nreturn if diabetes is subsequently resolved.\n\n**QOF Requirements:**\n\
    - NDH001: Practice can produce a register of patients with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia\n- Supports diabetes prevention\
    \ and lifestyle intervention indicators\n- Links to HbA1c monitoring and cardiovascular risk assessment\n\n**Exclusion\
    \ Logic:**\n- Rule 1: Age \u226518 years (rejects patients under 18)\n- Rule 2: Has NDH diagnosis AND never had diabetes\n\
    - Rule 3: Has NDH diagnosis AND diabetes is resolved\n\n**Data Sources:**\n- NDH codes: int_ndh_diagnoses_all (NDH_COD,\
    \ IGT_COD, PRD_COD cluster IDs)\n- Diabetes exclusion: int_diabetes_diagnoses_all (DM_COD, DMRES_COD cluster IDs)\n- Age\
    \ filtering: dim_person_age (\u226518 years requirement)\n\nIncludes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) for comprehensive\
    \ reporting.\n"
