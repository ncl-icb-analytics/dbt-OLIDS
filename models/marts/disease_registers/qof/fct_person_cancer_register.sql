Key Inclusion Criteria:
â€¢ Cancer diagnosis (CAN_COD) on/after 1 April 2003
â€¢ No age restrictions
â€¢ No resolution codes (cancer is permanent condition)
â€¢ Excludes non-melanotic skin cancers (handled in cluster definition)

Purpose: QOF register for cancer survivorship care, follow-up monitoring, and quality measures for cancer management.

/*
Cancer Register - QOF Quality Measures
Tracks all patients with cancer diagnoses on/after April 1, 2003.

Simple Register Pattern with Date Filter:
- Presence of cancer diagnosis on/after 1 April 2003 = on register
- No resolution codes (cancer is permanent)
- No age restrictions
- Excludes non-melanotic skin cancers (handled in cluster definition)

QOF Business Rules:
1. Cancer diagnosis (CAN_COD) on/after 1 April 2003 qualifies for register
2. Cancer is considered a permanent condition - no resolution
3. Used for survivorship care and follow-up monitoring
4. Supports cancer care quality measures
