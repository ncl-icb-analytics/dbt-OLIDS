      QOF Asthma Register - Complex QOF register requiring external medication validation.
      
      **Business Logic (Pattern 3):**
      - Age ≥6 years (QOF requirement for asthma monitoring)
      - Active asthma diagnosis: latest AST_COD > latest ASTRES_COD OR no resolution recorded
      - Recent medication validation: asthma medication prescribed within last 12 months
      - ALL three criteria must be met for register inclusion
      
      **Clinical Context:**
      This register identifies patients actively managed for asthma, validated through 
      both diagnostic coding and medication prescribing patterns. The medication requirement 
      ensures patients are receiving active treatment rather than historical diagnoses.
      
      **QOF Requirements:**
      - AST001: Practice can produce a register of patients with asthma (all ages)
      - Medication validation confirms active disease management
      - Supports QOF indicators for asthma monitoring and treatment optimisation
      
      **Data Sources:**
      - Diagnosis codes: int_asthma_diagnoses_all (AST_COD, ASTRES_COD cluster IDs)
      - Medication validation: int_asthma_medications_12m (12-month lookback)
      - Age filtering: dim_person_age (≥6 years requirement)
      
      Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) for comprehensive reporting.
