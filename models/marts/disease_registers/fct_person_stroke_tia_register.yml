      **Stroke/TIA Register - QOF Cardiovascular Disease Quality Measures**
      
      Fact table for stroke/TIA register following simple register pattern. All patients with 
      any stroke or TIA diagnosis are included on the register.
      
      Simple Register Business Logic:
      - Presence of stroke or TIA diagnosis = on register (lifelong condition)
      - No resolution codes (stroke/TIA are permanent)
      - No age restrictions
      - Important for secondary prevention monitoring
      
      QOF Context:
      Used for cerebrovascular disease secondary prevention quality measures including:
      - Secondary prevention medication monitoring
      - Cardiovascular risk management and anticoagulation decisions
      - Blood pressure management targets
      - Neurological follow-up coordination
      
      Matches legacy fct_person_dx_stia business logic and field structure.
