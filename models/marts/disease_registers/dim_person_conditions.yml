    description: 'Person Conditions Dimension - Complete population view with explicit boolean flags for each condition.


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per person in the population (includes ALL persons from dim_person)

      • Persons with no conditions have all flags set to FALSE and counts to 0

      • Complete population coverage for accurate prevalence calculations


      Key Features:

      • Explicit TRUE/FALSE boolean columns for each condition (no nulls)

      • Summary counts for total conditions and QOF conditions (0 for no conditions)

      • Clinical domain counts (cardiovascular, respiratory, etc.)

      • Earliest and latest diagnosis dates (NULL only for persons with no conditions)


      Purpose: Complete analytical table for condition profiling, multi-morbidity analysis, and population health dashboards. Eliminates null-handling complexity by providing explicit boolean values for every person in the population.'
