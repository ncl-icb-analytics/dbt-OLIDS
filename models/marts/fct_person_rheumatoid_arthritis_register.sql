/*
Rheumatoid Arthritis Register - QOF Quality Measures
Tracks all patients aged 16+ with rheumatoid arthritis diagnoses.

Simple Register Pattern with Age Filter:
- Presence of RA diagnosis for age â‰¥16 = on register
- No resolution codes (RA is permanent)
- Age restriction: patients must be 16+ years
- Important for DMARDs monitoring

QOF Business Rules:
1. RA diagnosis (RARTH_COD) for patients aged 16+ qualifies for register
2. RA is considered a permanent condition - no resolution
3. Used for DMARDs therapy monitoring and joint health assessment
4. Supports rheumatology care quality measures

Matches legacy fct_person_dx_ra business logic and field structure.
