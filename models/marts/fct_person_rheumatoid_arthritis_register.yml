      **Rheumatoid Arthritis Register - QOF Quality Measures**
      
      Fact table for RA register with age filter. All patients aged 16+ with RA diagnosis 
      are included on the register.
      
      Simple Register Business Logic with Age Filter:
      - RA diagnosis for age â‰¥16 = on register
      - No resolution codes (RA is permanent)
      - Age restriction: patients must be 16+ years
      - Important for DMARDs monitoring
      
      QOF Context:
      Used for rheumatoid arthritis quality measures including:
      - DMARDs therapy monitoring and joint health assessment
      - Disease progression monitoring
      - Specialist rheumatology care coordination
      - Treatment response evaluation
      
      Matches legacy fct_person_dx_ra business logic and field structure.
