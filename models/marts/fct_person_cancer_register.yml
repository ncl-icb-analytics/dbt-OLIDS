      **Cancer Register - QOF Quality Measures**
      
      Fact table for cancer register with date filter. All patients with cancer diagnosis 
      on/after April 1, 2003 are included on the register.
      
      Simple Register Business Logic with Date Filter:
      - Cancer diagnosis on/after 1 April 2003 = on register
      - No resolution codes (cancer is permanent)
      - No age restrictions
      - Excludes non-melanotic skin cancers (handled in cluster definition)
      
      QOF Context:
      Used for cancer care quality measures including:
      - Survivorship care and follow-up monitoring
      - Cancer care pathway tracking
      - Treatment outcome monitoring
      - Care coordination quality measures
      
      Note: Legacy includes episode timing flags, but keeping this model simple 
      per architectural guidance. Episode analysis can be done separately if needed.
      
      Matches legacy fct_person_dx_cancer business logic and field structure.
