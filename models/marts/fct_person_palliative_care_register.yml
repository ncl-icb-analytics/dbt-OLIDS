      **Palliative Care Register - QOF End-of-Life Quality Measures**
      
      Pattern 2: Standard QOF Register with diagnosis + exclusion + date filter logic.
      
      QOF Business Logic:
      - Palliative care code (PALCARE_COD) on/after 1 April 2008 (QOF date threshold)
      - NOT marked as "no longer indicated" (PALCARENI_COD) after latest palliative care code
      - No age restrictions for palliative care register
      - Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) for comprehensive reporting
      
      QOF Context:
      Used for palliative care quality measures including:
      - End-of-life care coordination and monitoring
      - Palliative care pathway assessment
      - Appropriate care targeting and service provision
      - Quality of life measurement and improvement
      
      Matches legacy fct_person_dx_palliative_care business logic and field structure.
