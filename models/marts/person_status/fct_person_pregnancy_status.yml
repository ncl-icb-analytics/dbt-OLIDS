    description: 'Current Pregnancy Status - Determines current pregnancy status based on recent codes.


      Business Logic:

      • Population: Non-male individuals only

      • Current pregnancy: Latest pregnancy code > latest delivery code

      • Risk assessment: Child-bearing age (0-55 years) for medication safety

      • Clinical codes: Uses pregnancy codes vs delivery/termination codes


      Purpose: Clinical decision support for medication safety, care planning, and pregnancy-related interventions.'
