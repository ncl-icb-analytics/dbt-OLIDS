      **Depression Register - QOF Mental Health Quality Measures**
      
      Pattern 2: Standard QOF Register with diagnosis + resolution logic.
      
      QOF Business Logic:
      - Age â‰¥18 years (QOF requirement)
      - Latest depression episode on/after 1 April 2006 (QOF date threshold)
      - Unresolved: latest_depression_date > latest_resolved_date OR no resolved code
      - Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) for comprehensive reporting
      
      QOF Context:
      Used for depression quality measures including:
      - Depression care pathways and treatment monitoring
      - Recovery planning and review scheduling
      - Psychological therapy access monitoring
      - Medication management and compliance
      
      Matches legacy fct_person_dx_depression business logic and field structure.
