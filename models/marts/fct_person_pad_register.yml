      **PAD Register - QOF Cardiovascular Disease Quality Measures**
      
      Fact table for PAD register following simple register pattern. All patients with any PAD 
      diagnosis are included on the register as PAD is considered a permanent condition.
      
      Simple Register Business Logic:
      - Presence of PAD diagnosis = on register (lifelong condition)
      - No resolution codes (PAD is permanent)
      - No age restrictions
      - Important for secondary prevention monitoring
      
      QOF Context:
      Used for cardiovascular disease secondary prevention quality measures including:
      - Medication monitoring (statins, antiplatelets, ACE inhibitors)
      - Blood pressure management targets
      - Cholesterol management
      - Limb preservation and vascular health monitoring
      
      Matches legacy fct_person_dx_pad business logic and field structure.
