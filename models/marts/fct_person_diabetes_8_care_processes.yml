      Fact table tracking completion of the 8 diabetes care processes for people on the diabetes register.
      
      **8 Care Processes:**
      1. HbA1c test
      2. Blood pressure check
      3. Cholesterol test
      4. Serum creatinine test
      5. Urine ACR test
      6. Foot examination
      7. BMI recording
      8. Smoking status recording
      
      **Business Logic:**
      - Base population: Anyone with a diabetes diagnosis (from int_diabetes_diagnoses_all)
      - Completion timeframe: Within last 12 months from current date
      - Foot check logic: Requires both feet checked OR one foot checked with other absent/amputated, AND not declined/unsuitable
      - Overall completion: Count of completed processes (0-8) and flag for all 8 completed
      
      **Clinical Context:**
      Essential for diabetes quality of care monitoring and QOF reporting. Based on NICE diabetes guidelines
      requiring regular monitoring of these key clinical parameters.
