    description: 'Business data quality monitoring tool for BMI measurements.

      Business Logic:

      • Identifies BMI measurements with data quality issues: out-of-range values, extreme outliers, and missing dates

      • Supports clinical governance teams in monitoring data quality and enabling data stewards to resolve BMI recording issues

      • Flags BMI values <10 or >150 as out-of-range

      • Additional flagging for extreme outliers (<8 or >100) for investigation

      • One row per BMI observation with data quality issues for quality assurance reporting'
