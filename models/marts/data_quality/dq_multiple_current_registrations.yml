    description: 'Business data quality monitoring tool for patient registration data.

      Business Logic:

      • Identifies persons with multiple simultaneous current registrations

      • Supports clinical governance teams in monitoring registration data quality

      • Flags registration end date issues: NULL dates, future dates, and illogical date sequences

      • Detects overlapping registration periods across different practices

      • Provides severity scoring to prioritise data quality remediation efforts

      • One row per current registration for persons with multiple current registrations

      Data Quality Impact:

      • Multiple current registrations cause duplicates in dim_person and downstream models

      • Affects accurate patient counting and practice list sizes

      • May impact funding calculations based on registered patient numbers'
