    description: 'Business data quality monitoring tool for blood pressure measurements.


      Business Logic:

      • Identifies blood pressure readings with data quality issues: out-of-range values, orphaned readings, coding ambiguity, and missing dates

      • Supports clinical governance teams in monitoring data quality and enabling data stewards to resolve BP recording issues

      • Flags systolic values <40 or >350 mmHg and diastolic values <20 or >200 mmHg as out-of-range

      • One row per person per date with blood pressure data quality issues for quality assurance reporting'
