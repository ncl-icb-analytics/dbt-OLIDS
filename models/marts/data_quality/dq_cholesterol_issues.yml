    description: 'Business data quality monitoring tool for cholesterol measurements.

      Business Logic:

      • Identifies cholesterol measurements with data quality issues: out-of-range values, extreme outliers, and missing dates

      • Supports clinical governance teams in monitoring data quality and enabling data stewards to resolve cholesterol recording issues

      • Flags cholesterol values <0.5 or >20 mmol/L as out-of-range (maintains current clinically validated range)

      • Additional flagging for extreme outliers (>15 mmol/L) for investigation

      • One row per cholesterol observation with data quality issues for quality assurance reporting'
