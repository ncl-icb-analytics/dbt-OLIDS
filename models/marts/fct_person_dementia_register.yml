      **Dementia Register - QOF Mental Health Quality Measures**
      
      Pattern 1: Simple Register with diagnosis only.
      
      QOF Business Logic:
      - Presence of dementia diagnosis (DEM_COD) = on register
      - No resolution codes (dementia is permanent condition)  
      - No age restrictions for dementia register
      - Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) for comprehensive reporting
      
      QOF Context:
      Used for dementia quality measures including:
      - Dementia care pathway monitoring
      - Cognitive health assessment support
      - Memory service referral tracking
      - Early detection and ongoing care
      
      Matches legacy fct_person_dx_dementia business logic and field structure.
