      **Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Register - QOF Cardiovascular Quality Measures**
      
      Fact table for FH register following simple register pattern. All patients with any FH 
      diagnosis are included on the register.
      
      Simple Register Business Logic:
      - Presence of FH diagnosis = on register (genetic condition - lifelong)
      - No resolution codes (FH is permanent genetic condition)
      - No age restrictions for diagnosis inclusion
      - Important for high-intensity statin therapy and cascade screening
      
      QOF Context:
      Used for familial hypercholesterolaemia quality measures including:
      - High-intensity statin therapy monitoring
      - Family cascade screening programmes
      - Cardiovascular risk management
      - Genetic counselling support
      
      Matches legacy fct_person_dx_fhyp business logic and field structure.
