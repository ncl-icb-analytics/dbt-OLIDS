Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ Valproate medication safety monitoring and pregnancy risk assessment
â€¢ Clinical decision support for contraindicated medications during pregnancy
â€¢ Safety-critical pharmaceutical prescribing and monitoring
â€¢ Reproductive health risk stratification and patient safety protocols

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per pregnancy absence risk observation
â€¢ Uses PREGRISK category codes from valproate programme
â€¢ Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive safety monitoring

Key Features:
â€¢ Permanent pregnancy risk absence indicators for medication safety
â€¢ Critical for teratogenic medication prescribing decisions
â€¢ Essential for clinical safety and pharmaceutical risk management
â€¢ Supports reproductive health and medication safety protocols
