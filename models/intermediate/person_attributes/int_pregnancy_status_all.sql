Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ Pregnancy status tracking and maternity care pathway coordination
â€¢ Medication safety monitoring during pregnancy and post-pregnancy periods
â€¢ Clinical decision support for pregnancy-contraindicated treatments
â€¢ Maternity care quality improvement and outcome tracking

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per pregnancy-related observation with enhanced timeframe analysis
â€¢ Uses PREG_COD (pregnancy status) and PREGDEL_COD (delivery events) QOF clusters
â€¢ Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive maternity care

Key Features:
â€¢ Enhanced pregnancy status categorisation and clinical safety context
â€¢ Maternity care timeframe analysis for clinical decision support
â€¢ Pregnancy outcome tracking including live births and terminations
â€¢ Critical for medication safety and reproductive health monitoring

/*
All pregnancy-related observations with enhanced analytics features.
Uses QOF pregnancy cluster IDs: PREG_COD (pregnancy status), PREGDEL_COD (delivery events).

Enhanced Analytics Features:
- Pregnancy status categorisation and clinical context
- Enhanced timeframe analysis for maternity care
- Clinical safety integration support (e.g., medication contraindications)

Single Responsibility: Pregnancy observation data collection with analytics enhancement.
Includes ALL persons following intermediate layer principles.
