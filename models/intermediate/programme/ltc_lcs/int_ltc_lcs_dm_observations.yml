    description: 'Intermediate: LTC LCS DM Observations - All diabetes-relevant observations for Long Term Conditions case finding measures.


      Clinical Purpose:

      • Tracks comprehensive diabetes-related clinical observation data for case finding algorithms

      • Supports identification of patients with undiagnosed diabetes through laboratory and clinical observations

      • Enables observation-based risk stratification using HbA1c measurements and diabetes risk scores

      • Provides foundation data for diabetes case finding indicators including gestational diabetes risk


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per clinical observation for diabetes-relevant observations

      • Includes HbA1c levels, QDiabetes risk scores, QRISK2 scores, BMI measurements

      • Covers gestational diabetes history and pregnancy risk observations

      • Sourced from LTC_LCS programme observation clusters


      Key Features:

      • Cluster IDs: HBA1C_LEVEL, QDIABETES_RISK, QRISK2_10YEAR, HISTORY_GESTATIONAL_DIABETES, GESTATIONAL_DIABETES_PREGNANCY_RISK, BMI_MEASUREMENT

      • Supports diabetes case finding measures using laboratory and risk assessment data

      • Comprehensive diabetes risk factor and diagnostic observation analysis • Integration with LTC_LCS programme clinical observation tracking systems'
