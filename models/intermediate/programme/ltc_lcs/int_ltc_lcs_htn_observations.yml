    description: 'Intermediate: LTC LCS HTN Observations - Collects all hypertension-relevant observations for Long Term Conditions case finding measures including blood pressure measurements.


      Clinical Purpose:

      • Gathers comprehensive hypertension-related clinical observation data for case finding algorithms

      • Supports identification of patients with undiagnosed hypertension through blood pressure measurements

      • Enables observation-based risk stratification using clinic, home, and ABPM blood pressure readings

      • Provides foundation data for hypertension case finding indicators with proper BP measurement pairing


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per clinical observation for hypertension-relevant observations

      • Covers clinic, home, and ABPM blood pressure events with systolic/diastolic pairing

      • Includes other hypertension-related observations: eGFR, BMI, BSA, cardiovascular complications

      • Sourced from int_blood_pressure_all and LTC_LCS programme observation clusters


      Key Features:

      • Cluster IDs: HYPERTENSION_BP_CLINIC, HYPERTENSION_BP_HOME, HYPERTENSION_BP_ABPM, HYPERTENSION_EGFR, HYPERTENSION_BMI, HYPERTENSION_BSA, HYPERTENSION_MYOCARDIAL, HYPERTENSION_CEREBRAL, HYPERTENSION_CLAUDICATION, HYPERTENSION_DIABETES

      • Proper blood pressure measurement pairing logic with observation type classification

      • Comprehensive hypertension risk factor and diagnostic observation analysis

      • Integration with existing blood pressure intermediate model and LTC_LCS observation clusters'
