    description: 'Intermediate: LTC LCS AF Observations - All atrial fibrillation-relevant observations for Long Term Conditions case finding measures.


      Clinical Purpose:

      • Tracks comprehensive AF-related clinical observation data for case finding algorithms

      • Supports identification of patients with undiagnosed atrial fibrillation through clinical observations

      • Enables observation-based risk stratification for AF case finding measures

      • Provides foundation data for AF_61 and AF_62 case finding indicators


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per clinical observation for AF-relevant observations

      • Includes AF observations, exclusions, deep vein thrombosis, atrial flutter, pulse measurements

      • Sourced from LTC_LCS programme observation clusters

      • Covers all historical and current AF clinical observation patterns


      Key Features:

      • Cluster IDs: AF_OBSERVATIONS, AF_EXCLUSIONS, DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS, ATRIAL_FLUTTER, ATRIAL_FIBRILLATION_61_EXCLUSIONS, PULSE_RATE, PULSE_RHYTHM

      • Supports both AF_61 and AF_62 case finding measure requirements

      • Comprehensive clinical observation analysis for undiagnosed AF detection • Integration with LTC_LCS programme clinical observation tracking systems'
