  description: 'Intermediate: LTC LCS AF Observations - Collects all atrial fibrillation-relevant observations for Long Term Conditions case finding measures.


    Clinical Purpose:

    • Gathers comprehensive AF-related clinical observation data for case finding algorithms

    • Supports identification of patients with undiagnosed atrial fibrillation through clinical observations

    • Enables observation-based risk stratification for AF case finding measures

    • Provides foundation data for AF_61 and AF_62 case finding indicators


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per clinical observation for AF-relevant observations

    • Covers AF observations, exclusions, deep vein thrombosis, atrial flutter, pulse measurements

    • Sourced from LTC_LCS programme observation clusters

    • Includes all historical and current AF clinical observation patterns


    Key Features:


    • Cluster IDs: AF_OBSERVATIONS, AF_EXCLUSIONS, DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS, ATRIAL_FLUTTER, ATRIAL_FIBRILLATION_61_EXCLUSIONS, PULSE_RATE, PULSE_RHYTHM

    • Supports both AF_61 and AF_62 case finding measure requirements

    • Comprehensive clinical observation analysis for undiagnosed AF detection

    • Integration with LTC_LCS programme clinical observation tracking systems'
