    description: 'Intermediate: LTC LCS CVD Observations - All cardiovascular disease-relevant observations for Long Term Conditions case finding measures.


      Clinical Purpose:

      • Tracks comprehensive CVD-related clinical observation data for case finding algorithms

      • Supports identification of patients requiring CVD risk assessment through clinical observations

      • Enables observation-based risk stratification using QRISK2 scores and cholesterol measurements

      • Provides foundation data for CVD case finding indicators including statin decision tracking


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per clinical observation for CVD-relevant observations

      • Includes QRISK2 10-year scores, non-HDL cholesterol measurements

      • Covers statin allergy/adverse reactions, contraindications, and clinical decisions

      • Sourced from LTC_LCS programme observation clusters


      Key Features:

      • Cluster IDs: QRISK2_10YEAR, NON_HDL_CHOLESTEROL, STATIN_ALLERGY_ADVERSE_REACTION, STATIN_NOT_INDICATED, STATINDEC_COD

      • Supports cardiovascular risk assessment and primary prevention case finding

      • Comprehensive clinical decision tracking for statin prescribing • Integration with LTC_LCS programme clinical observation tracking systems'
