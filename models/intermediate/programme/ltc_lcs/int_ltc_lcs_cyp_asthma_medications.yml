  description: 'Intermediate: LTC LCS CYP Asthma Medications - Collects all children and young people asthma-relevant medications for Long Term Conditions case finding measures.


    Clinical Purpose:

    • Gathers comprehensive CYP asthma-related medication data for case finding algorithms

    • Supports identification of children and young people with undiagnosed asthma through medication patterns

    • Enables medication-based risk stratification for paediatric asthma case finding measures

    • Provides foundation data for CYP asthma case finding indicators


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per medication order for CYP asthma-relevant medications

    • Covers asthma medications, prednisolone (oral steroids), and montelukast (leukotriene receptor antagonist)

    • Sourced from LTC_LCS programme medication clusters for paediatric populations

    • Includes all historical and current asthma medication patterns for children and young people


    Key Features:


    • Cluster IDs: ASTHMA_MEDICATIONS, ASTHMA_PREDNISOLONE, MONTELUKAST_MEDICATIONS

    • Supports CYP-specific asthma case finding measure requirements

    • Comprehensive paediatric medication pattern analysis for undiagnosed asthma detection

    • Integration with LTC_LCS programme medication tracking systems for children and young people'
