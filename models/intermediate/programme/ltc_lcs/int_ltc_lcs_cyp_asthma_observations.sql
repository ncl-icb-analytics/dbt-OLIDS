        "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Intermediate: LTC LCS CYP Asthma Observations - Collects all children and young people asthma-relevant observations for Long Term Conditions case finding measures.

Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ Gathers comprehensive CYP asthma-related clinical observation data for case finding algorithms
â€¢ Supports identification of children and young people with undiagnosed asthma through clinical observations
â€¢ Enables observation-based risk stratification for paediatric asthma case finding measures
â€¢ Provides foundation data for CYP asthma case finding indicators including suspected asthma and wheeze

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per clinical observation for CYP asthma-relevant observations
â€¢ Covers suspected asthma, viral wheeze, asthma diagnosis, and asthma resolved observations
â€¢ Sourced from LTC_LCS programme observation clusters for paediatric populations
â€¢ Includes all historical and current asthma clinical observation patterns for children and young people

Key Features:
â€¢ Cluster IDs: SUSPECTED_ASTHMA, VIRAL_WHEEZE, ASTHMA_DIAGNOSIS, ASTHMA_RESOLVED
â€¢ Supports CYP-specific asthma case finding measure requirements
â€¢ Comprehensive paediatric clinical observation analysis for undiagnosed asthma detection
â€¢ Integration with LTC_LCS programme clinical observation tracking systems for children and young people
