  description: 'Intermediate: LTC LCS CKD Observations - Collects all chronic kidney disease-relevant observations for Long Term Conditions case finding measures.


    Clinical Purpose:

    • Gathers comprehensive CKD-related clinical observation data for case finding algorithms

    • Supports identification of patients with undiagnosed chronic kidney disease through laboratory and clinical observations

    • Enables observation-based risk stratification for CKD case finding measures CKD_61 and CKD_62

    • Provides foundation data for CKD case finding indicators including consecutive low eGFR readings


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per clinical observation for CKD-relevant observations

    • Covers urine ACR testing, eGFR testing, acute kidney injury, BPH/gout, haematuria, proteinuria

    • Includes medication-related observations: lithium, sulfasalazine, tacrolimus

    • Sourced from LTC_LCS programme observation clusters


    Key Features:

    • Cluster IDs: UACR_TESTING, EGFR_TESTING, CKD_ACUTE_KIDNEY_INJURY, CKD_BPH_GOUT, HAEMATURIA, LITHIUM_MEDICATIONS, SULFASALAZINE_MEDICATIONS, TACROLIMUS_MEDICATIONS, URINE_BLOOD_NEGATIVE, PROTEINURIA_FINDINGS

    • Supports CKD_61 (consecutive low eGFR) and CKD_62 (elevated ACR) case finding measures

    • Comprehensive laboratory and clinical observation analysis for undiagnosed CKD detection

    • Integration with LTC_LCS programme clinical observation tracking systems'
