  description: 'Intermediate: LTC LCS CYP Asthma Observations - Collects all children and young people asthma-relevant observations for Long Term Conditions case finding measures.


    Clinical Purpose:

    • Gathers comprehensive CYP asthma-related clinical observation data for case finding algorithms

    • Supports identification of children and young people with undiagnosed asthma through clinical observations

    • Enables observation-based risk stratification for paediatric asthma case finding measures

    • Provides foundation data for CYP asthma case finding indicators including suspected asthma and wheeze


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per clinical observation for CYP asthma-relevant observations

    • Covers suspected asthma, viral wheeze, asthma diagnosis, and asthma resolved observations

    • Sourced from LTC_LCS programme observation clusters for paediatric populations

    • Includes all historical and current asthma clinical observation patterns for children and young people


    Key Features:


    • Cluster IDs: SUSPECTED_ASTHMA, VIRAL_WHEEZE, ASTHMA_DIAGNOSIS, ASTHMA_RESOLVED

    • Supports CYP-specific asthma case finding measure requirements

    • Comprehensive paediatric clinical observation analysis for undiagnosed asthma detection

    • Integration with LTC_LCS programme clinical observation tracking systems for children and young people'
