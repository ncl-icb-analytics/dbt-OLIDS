    description: 'Intermediate: LTC LCS CYP Asthma Observations - All children and young people asthma-relevant observations for Long Term Conditions case finding measures.


      Clinical Purpose:

      • Tracks comprehensive CYP asthma-related clinical observation data for case finding algorithms

      • Supports identification of children and young people with undiagnosed asthma through clinical observations

      • Enables observation-based risk stratification for paediatric asthma case finding measures

      • Provides foundation data for CYP asthma case finding indicators including suspected asthma and wheeze


      Data Granularity:
