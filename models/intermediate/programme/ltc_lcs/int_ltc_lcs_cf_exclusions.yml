      • Supports efficient healthcare resource allocation by avoiding duplicate targeting

      • Maintains data quality in case finding programme reporting

      Key Features:

      • Comprehensive LTC condition screening across multiple disease registers

      • Boolean aggregation for efficient condition presence checking
