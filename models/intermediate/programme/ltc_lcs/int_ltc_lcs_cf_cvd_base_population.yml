    description: 'Intermediate: LTC LCS CF CVD Base Population - Specialised CVD base population for Long Term Conditions case finding indicators with statin exclusions.


      Clinical Purpose:

      • Establishes specialised base population for CVD case finding measures requiring statin status filtering

      • Applies comprehensive statin exclusions for patients already on statins, with allergies, or recent decisions

      • Ensures appropriate population selection for CVD primary prevention case finding

      • Provides consistent population denominator for CVD case finding indicators requiring statin-naive patients


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per eligible person aged 40-83 years for CVD case finding programmes

      • Excludes patients on statins in last 12 months, with statin allergies/contraindications, or recent statin decisions

      • Builds on standard LTC case finding base population with additional CVD-specific exclusions

      • Includes statin status flags and latest dates for comprehensive filtering


      Key Features:

      • Age-specific population: 40-83 years for CVD primary prevention targeting

      • Comprehensive statin exclusion logic: current statins, allergies, contraindications, recent decisions

      • Integration with CVD medications and observations for statin status determination • Reusable base population for multiple CVD case finding indicators requiring statin-naive patients'
