    description: 'Extracts all neurology-related events from observations using valproate programme codes.


      Business Logic:

      • Joins observations with mapped concepts and valproate programme codes

      • Filters to NEUROLOGY code category only

      • One row per neurology observation with person, date, concept details

      • Foundation data for neurology dimension aggregation'
