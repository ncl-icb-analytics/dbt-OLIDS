  description: 'Intermediate: Valproate Neurology Events - Comprehensive collection of all neurology-related events for valproate patient safety monitoring.


    Clinical Purpose:

    • Gathers all neurology specialty events for patients on valproate therapy

    • Supports neurology pathway tracking for valproate patient safety monitoring

    • Enables comprehensive monitoring of neurological care in valproate safety programme

    • Provides foundation data for valproate programme neurology specialty analysis


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per neurology event observation for patients on valproate therapy

    • Covers all neurology-related observations using NEUROLOGY code category

    • Includes clinical effective dates for temporal analysis and neurology pathway tracking

    • Contains concept codes and descriptions for detailed neurology event documentation


    Key Features:

    • NEUROLOGY code category filtering for comprehensive neurology event capture

    • Integration with valproate programme codes for neurology pathway tracking

    • Support for neurology specialty monitoring in valproate safety programme

    • Foundation data for neurological care pathway analysis in valproate patients'
