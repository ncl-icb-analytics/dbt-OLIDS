        "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Intermediate: Valproate Neurology Events - Comprehensive collection of all neurology-related events for valproate patient safety monitoring.

Clinical Purpose:
• Gathers all neurology specialty events for patients on valproate therapy
• Supports neurology pathway tracking for valproate patient safety monitoring
• Enables comprehensive monitoring of neurological care in valproate safety programme
• Provides foundation data for valproate programme neurology specialty analysis

Data Granularity:
• One row per neurology event observation for patients on valproate therapy
• Covers all neurology-related observations using NEUROLOGY code category
• Includes clinical effective dates for temporal analysis and neurology pathway tracking
• Contains concept codes and descriptions for detailed neurology event documentation

Key Features:
• NEUROLOGY code category filtering for comprehensive neurology event capture
• Integration with valproate programme codes for neurology pathway tracking
• Support for neurology specialty monitoring in valproate safety programme
• Foundation data for neurological care pathway analysis in valproate patients
