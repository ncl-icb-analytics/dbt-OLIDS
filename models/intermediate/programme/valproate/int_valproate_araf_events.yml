  description: 'Extracts all ARAF events from observations using valproate programme codes.

    Business Logic:
    • Joins observations with mapped concepts and valproate programme codes
    • Filters to ARAF code category only
    • One row per ARAF observation with person, date, concept details
    • Includes specific ARAF form code identification and lookback logic
    • Foundation data for ARAF dimension aggregation'
  columns:
  - name: person_id
    description: Unique identifier for the person.

  - name: araf_event_date
    description: Date of the ARAF-related observation.
  - name: araf_observation_id
