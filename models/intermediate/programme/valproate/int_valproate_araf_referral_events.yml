    description: 'Extracts all ARAF referral events from observations using valproate programme codes.


      Business Logic:

      • Joins observations with mapped concepts and valproate programme codes

      • Filters to REFERRAL code category only

      • One row per ARAF referral observation with person, date, concept details

      • Foundation data for ARAF referral dimension aggregation'
