        "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Intermediate: PPP Status All - Comprehensive collection of all Pregnancy Prevention Programme status events for valproate patient safety monitoring.

Clinical Purpose:
• Gathers all PPP status events for women of childbearing potential on valproate therapy
• Supports pregnancy prevention programme monitoring for valproate clinical safety
• Enables comprehensive tracking of PPP enrollment, discontinuation, and clinical decisions
• Provides foundation data for valproate programme safety compliance reporting

Data Granularity:
• One row per PPP status observation for patients on valproate therapy
• Covers PPP enrolled, discontinued, not needed, and declined status events
• Includes clinical effective dates for temporal analysis and programme tracking
• Contains concept codes and descriptions for detailed clinical documentation

Key Features:
• PPP status categorisation: enrolled, discontinued, not needed, declined
• Integration with valproate programme codes for comprehensive status tracking
• Raw data collection layer feeding downstream PPP dimension table
• Support for valproate patient safety monitoring and regulatory compliance
