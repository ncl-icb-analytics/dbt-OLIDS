/*
Flu Age-Based Rules Intermediate Model

Handles age threshold eligibility rules for flu vaccination programme.
These rules are based purely on age calculations against campaign reference dates.

Age-based rule groups:
- OVER65_GROUP: Everyone aged 65 and over at campaign reference date
- Child age groups use AGE_BIRTH_RANGE rule type (handled separately)

This model replaces the apply_age_based_rule macro functionality.
Campaign is configurable via dbt variables.

Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ NHS flu vaccination programme age-based eligibility calculation
â€¢ OVER65_GROUP population identification and campaign management
â€¢ Age threshold validation against campaign reference dates
â€¢ Foundation for flu vaccination programme coverage and uptake monitoring

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per person meeting age-based eligibility criteria
â€¢ Uses campaign-specific age thresholds and reference dates
â€¢ Includes all patients meeting age criteria for comprehensive programme coverage

Key Features:
â€¢ Age 65+ eligibility determination for high-risk population
â€¢ Campaign-configurable reference date calculations
â€¢ Essential for flu vaccination programme targeting and coverage reporting
â€¢ Foundation for age-based vaccination prioritisation and resource planning
