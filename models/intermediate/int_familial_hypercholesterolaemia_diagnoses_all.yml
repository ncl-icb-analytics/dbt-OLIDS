    description: |
      All familial hypercholesterolaemia diagnosis observations from clinical records.
      Simple diagnostic pattern with no resolved codes as FHYP is a permanent genetic condition.
      
      QOF Register Logic:
      - Familial hypercholesterolaemia diagnosis (FHYP_COD)
      - No resolution codes - FHYP is permanent genetic condition
      - No age restrictions for FHYP register
      - Important for high-intensity statin therapy and family screening
      
      Includes ALL persons following intermediate layer principles.
      Use as input for fct_person_familial_hypercholesterolaemia_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
