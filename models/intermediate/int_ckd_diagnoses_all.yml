    description: |
      All chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis observations from clinical records using QOF cluster IDs.
      Provides comprehensive data collection for CKD register and kidney function monitoring.
      
      QOF Cluster IDs Used:
      - CKD_COD: CKD diagnoses
      - CKDRES_COD: CKD resolved/remission codes
      
      Clinical Purpose:
      - QOF CKD register data collection (aged 18+, unresolved CKD diagnosis)
      - CKD staging and classification support
      - Kidney function monitoring
      - Resolution status tracking
      
      Key QOF Requirements:
      - Register inclusion: Age â‰¥18, latest unresolved CKD diagnosis
      - Lab correlation with eGFR and ACR values
      - CKD stage determination support
      - Laboratory confirmation tracking
      
      Note: This model provides diagnosis codes only. Lab-based CKD inference 
      (eGFR/ACR staging) is handled separately in intermediate_ckd_lab_inference.
      
      Includes ALL persons following intermediate layer principles.
      Use as input for fct_person_ckd_register.sql which applies QOF business rules and lab integration.
