/*
All rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnoses from clinical records.
Uses QOF cluster ID RARTH_COD for rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis codes.

Clinical Purpose:
- RA register inclusion for QOF quality measures
- Rheumatoid arthritis disease management monitoring
- DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs) prescribing support

QOF Context:
RA register follows simple diagnosis-only pattern with age restriction - any RA diagnosis 
for patients aged 16+ qualifies for register inclusion. No resolution codes.
This supports RA quality measures and specialist care monitoring.

Note: QOF RA register requires age â‰¥16 years at diagnosis.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
Use this model as input for RA register (with age filtering applied in fact layer).
