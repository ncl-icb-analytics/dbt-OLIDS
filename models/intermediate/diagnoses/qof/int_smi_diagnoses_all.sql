            "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Intermediate: SMI Diagnoses All - Complete history of all serious mental illness diagnosis and remission observations for QOF register management.

Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ QOF serious mental illness register data collection and monitoring
â€¢ Mental health care pathway coordination for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and psychoses
â€¢ SMI treatment response monitoring and clinical decision support
â€¢ Remission status tracking for improved mental health outcomes

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per serious mental illness diagnosis or remission observation
â€¢ Uses MH_COD (diagnosis) and MHREM_COD (remission) QOF clusters
â€¢ Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting

Key Features:
â€¢ Diagnosis and remission code classification for register eligibility
â€¢ Age restrictions typically â‰¥18 years applied in downstream processing
â€¢ Critical for serious mental illness care pathway optimisation
â€¢ Essential input for SMI quality improvement and treatment monitoring

/*
All serious mental illness (SMI) diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF SMI cluster IDs:
- MH_COD: Mental health diagnoses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, other psychoses)
- MHREM_COD: Mental health remission codes

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF SMI register data collection
- Mental health care pathway monitoring
- SMI treatment tracking
- Resolution status tracking

QOF Context:
SMI register includes persons with mental health diagnosis codes who have not
been resolved (no recent remission codes). Resolution logic applied in downstream fact models.
Age restrictions typically â‰¥18 years applied in fact layer.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per SMI observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_smi_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
