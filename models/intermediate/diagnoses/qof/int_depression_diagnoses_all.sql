Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ QOF depression register data collection and monitoring
â€¢ Mental health care pathway coordination and clinical decision support
â€¢ Depression severity tracking and treatment response monitoring
â€¢ Resolution status tracking for improved mental health outcomes

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per depression diagnosis or resolution observation
â€¢ Uses DEPR_COD (diagnosis) and DEPRES_COD (resolved) QOF clusters
â€¢ Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting

Key Features:
â€¢ Diagnosis and resolution code classification for register eligibility
â€¢ Age restrictions typically â‰¥18 years applied in downstream processing
â€¢ Critical for mental health care pathway optimisation
â€¢ Essential input for depression quality improvement initiatives

/*
All depression diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF depression cluster IDs:
- DEPR_COD: Depression diagnoses
- DEPRES_COD: Depression resolved/remission codes

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF depression register data collection
- Mental health care pathway monitoring
- Depression severity tracking
- Resolution status tracking

QOF Context:
Depression register includes persons with depression diagnosis codes who have not
been resolved. Resolution logic applied in downstream fact models.
Age restrictions typically â‰¥18 years applied in fact layer.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per depression observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_depression_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
