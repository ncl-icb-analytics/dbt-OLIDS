            "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Intermediate: Epilepsy Diagnoses All - Complete history of all epilepsy diagnosis and resolution observations for QOF register management.

Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ QOF epilepsy register data collection and monitoring
â€¢ Epilepsy care pathway coordination and seizure management tracking
â€¢ Neurological treatment monitoring and clinical decision support
â€¢ Resolution status tracking for improved neurological outcomes

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per epilepsy diagnosis or resolution observation
â€¢ Uses EPI_COD (diagnosis) and EPIRES_COD (resolved) QOF clusters
â€¢ Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting

Key Features:
â€¢ Diagnosis and resolution code classification for register eligibility
â€¢ Age restrictions typically â‰¥18 years applied in downstream processing
â€¢ Critical for epilepsy care pathway optimisation
â€¢ Essential input for neurological quality improvement initiatives

/*
All epilepsy diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF epilepsy cluster IDs:
- EPI_COD: Epilepsy diagnoses
- EPIRES_COD: Epilepsy resolved/remission codes

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF epilepsy register data collection
- Epilepsy care pathway monitoring
- Seizure management tracking
- Resolution status tracking

QOF Context:
Epilepsy register includes persons with epilepsy diagnosis codes who have not
been resolved. Resolution logic applied in downstream fact models.
Age restrictions typically â‰¥18 years applied in fact layer.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per epilepsy observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_epilepsy_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
