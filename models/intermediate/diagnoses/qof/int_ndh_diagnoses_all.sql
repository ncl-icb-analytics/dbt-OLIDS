Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ QOF non-diabetic hyperglycaemia register data collection and monitoring
â€¢ Pre-diabetes identification and diabetes prevention pathway coordination
â€¢ Glucose metabolism disorder tracking and intervention support
â€¢ Early intervention and lifestyle modification programme eligibility

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per NDH, IGT, or pre-diabetes diagnosis observation
â€¢ Uses NDH_COD, IGT_COD, and PRD_COD clusters
â€¢ Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting

Key Features:
â€¢ Pre-diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance identification
â€¢ Age restrictions (typically â‰¥18 years) applied in downstream processing
â€¢ Diabetes prevention programme eligibility determination
â€¢ Critical for early intervention and diabetes prevention strategies

/*
All non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (NDH) diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF NDH cluster IDs:
- NDH_COD: Non-diabetic hyperglycaemia diagnoses
- IGT_COD: Impaired glucose tolerance diagnoses
- PRD_COD: Pre-diabetes diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF NDH register data collection (aged 18+, never had diabetes OR diabetes resolved)
- Pre-diabetes monitoring and intervention
- Diabetes prevention pathway support
- Glucose metabolism disorder tracking

Key QOF Requirements:
- Register inclusion: NDH/IGT/PRD diagnosis for patients aged 18+
- Exclusion: Current unresolved diabetes (handled in fact layer)
- Diabetes history integration required for eligibility
- Important for diabetes prevention programmes

Complex register requiring integration with diabetes diagnosis history.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per NDH/IGT/PRD observation.
