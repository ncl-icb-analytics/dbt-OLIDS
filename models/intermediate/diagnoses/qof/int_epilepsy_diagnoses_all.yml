  description: 'Intermediate: Epilepsy Diagnoses All - Complete history of all epilepsy diagnosis and resolution observations for QOF register management.


    Clinical Purpose:

    • QOF epilepsy register data collection and monitoring

    • Epilepsy care pathway coordination and seizure management tracking

    • Neurological treatment monitoring and clinical decision support

    • Resolution status tracking for improved neurological outcomes


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per epilepsy diagnosis or resolution observation

    • Uses EPI_COD (diagnosis) and EPIRES_COD (resolved) QOF clusters

    • Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting


    Key Features:

    • Diagnosis and resolution code classification for register eligibility

    • Age restrictions typically ≥18 years applied in downstream processing

    • Critical for epilepsy care pathway optimisation

    • Essential input for neurological quality improvement initiatives'
