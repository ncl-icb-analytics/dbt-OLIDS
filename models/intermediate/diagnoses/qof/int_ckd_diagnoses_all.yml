  description: 'Intermediate: CKD Diagnoses All - Complete history of all chronic kidney disease diagnosis and resolution observations for QOF register management.


    Clinical Purpose:

    • QOF chronic kidney disease register data collection and monitoring

    • Kidney function deterioration tracking and staging

    • CKD progression monitoring and clinical decision support

    • Resolution status tracking for improved clinical outcomes


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per chronic kidney disease diagnosis or resolution observation

    • Uses CKD_COD (diagnosis) and CKDRES_COD (resolved) QOF clusters

    • Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting


    Key Features:

    • Diagnosis and resolution code classification for register eligibility

    • Age restrictions typically ≥18 years applied in downstream processing

    • Critical for kidney function monitoring and preservation protocols

    • Essential input for CKD care pathway optimisation'
