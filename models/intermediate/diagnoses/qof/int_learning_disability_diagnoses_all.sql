Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ QOF learning disability register data collection and monitoring
â€¢ Learning disability support service coordination and annual health checks
â€¢ Disability support pathway management and clinical decision support
â€¢ Learning disability care quality improvement and outcome tracking

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per learning disability diagnosis observation
â€¢ Uses LD_COD cluster for QOF-compliant learning disability identification
â€¢ Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting

Key Features:
â€¢ Annual health check eligibility determination (typically â‰¥14 years)
â€¢ Learning disability support service coordination
â€¢ Critical for disability care pathway optimisation
â€¢ Essential input for learning disability quality improvement initiatives

/*
All learning disability diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF learning disability cluster IDs:
- LD_COD: Learning disability diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF learning disability register data collection
- Learning disability support and monitoring
- Annual health checks eligibility
- Resolution status tracking

QOF Context:
Learning disability register includes persons with learning disability diagnosis codes
who have not been resolved. Resolution logic applied in downstream fact models.
Age restrictions typically â‰¥14 years applied in fact layer.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per learning disability observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_learning_disability_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
