  description: 'Intermediate: Asthma Diagnoses - All recorded asthma diagnosis and resolution codes for QOF register management.


    Clinical Purpose:

    • Tracks asthma diagnoses for QOF asthma register inclusion and respiratory care pathways

    • Supports asthma management programmes and clinical monitoring

    • Enables childhood and adult asthma care coordination and quality improvement


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per asthma diagnosis or resolution code

    • Uses AST_COD (diagnosis) and ASTRES_COD (resolved) QOF clusters

    • Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting


    Key Features:

    • Diagnosis and resolution code classification for register eligibility

    • QOF-compliant asthma register logic with resolution tracking

    • Age and clinical context considerations for downstream processing

    • Essential input for QOF asthma register and respiratory care analytics'
