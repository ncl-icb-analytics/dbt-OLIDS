Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ QOF dementia register data collection and monitoring
â€¢ Dementia care pathway coordination and cognitive assessment tracking
â€¢ Mental health service utilisation and quality improvement
â€¢ Long-term care planning and support service coordination

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per dementia diagnosis observation
â€¢ Uses DEM_COD cluster for QOF-compliant dementia diagnosis identification
â€¢ Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting

Key Features:
â€¢ Permanent condition tracking with no resolution codes
â€¢ No specific age restrictions for dementia register inclusion
â€¢ Critical for cognitive assessment and care pathway management
â€¢ Essential input for dementia care quality indicators

/*
All dementia diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF dementia cluster ID:
- DEM_COD: Dementia diagnoses (no resolution codes as dementia is permanent)

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF dementia register data collection
- Dementia care pathway monitoring
- Cognitive assessment tracking
- Resolution status tracking

QOF Context:
Dementia register includes persons with dementia diagnosis codes.
Dementia is considered a permanent condition with no resolution codes.
No specific age restrictions for dementia register.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per dementia observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_dementia_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
