    description: 'Intermediate: Stroke TIA Diagnoses All - Complete history of all stroke and TIA diagnosis observations for QOF register management.


      Clinical Purpose:

      • QOF stroke register data collection and monitoring

      • Cerebrovascular event tracking and secondary prevention pathway coordination

      • Stroke care pathway management and rehabilitation support

      • Long-term cardiovascular outcome tracking and intervention assessment


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per stroke or TIA diagnosis observation

      • Uses STRK_COD (stroke) and TIA_COD (TIA) QOF clusters

      • Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting


      Key Features:

      • Permanent cardiovascular event tracking with no resolution codes

      • No specific age restrictions for stroke register inclusion

      • Critical for cerebrovascular secondary prevention protocols

      • Essential input for stroke care quality improvement initiatives'
