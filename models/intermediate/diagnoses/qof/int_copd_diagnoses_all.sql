            "COMMENT ON TABLE {{ this }} IS 'Intermediate: COPD Diagnoses All - Complete history of all COPD diagnosis and resolution observations for QOF register management.

Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ QOF COPD register data collection and monitoring
â€¢ Respiratory function assessment and spirometry confirmation requirements
â€¢ COPD management pathway coordination and clinical decision support
â€¢ Resolution status tracking for improved respiratory outcomes

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per COPD diagnosis or resolution observation
â€¢ Uses COPD_COD (diagnosis) and COPDRES_COD (resolved) QOF clusters
â€¢ Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting

Key Features:
â€¢ Post-April 2023 spirometry confirmation requirements (FEV1/FVC <0.7)
â€¢ Integration with unable-to-have-spirometry status tracking
â€¢ Critical for respiratory care pathway optimisation
â€¢ Essential input for COPD quality improvement initiatives

/*
All COPD diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF COPD cluster IDs:
- COPD_COD: COPD diagnoses
- COPDRES_COD: COPD resolved/remission codes

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF COPD register data collection
- COPD spirometry confirmation requirements (post-April 2023)
- Respiratory management monitoring
- Resolution status tracking

Key QOF Requirements:
- Pre-April 2023: Diagnosis alone sufficient for register
- Post-April 2023: Requires spirometry confirmation (FEV1/FVC <0.7) OR unable-to-have-spirometry status

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per COPD observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_copd_register.sql which applies QOF business rules and spirometry requirements.
