Clinical Purpose:
• QOF osteoporosis register data collection and monitoring
• Bone health assessment and fracture risk stratification
• Osteoporosis care pathway coordination and treatment monitoring
• Integration with DXA scan results for comprehensive bone health evaluation

Data Granularity:
• One row per osteoporosis diagnosis observation
• Uses OSTEO_COD cluster for QOF-compliant osteoporosis identification
• Includes all patients regardless of status for comprehensive QOF reporting

Key Features:
• Clinical osteoporosis diagnosis tracking
• Integration with DXA scan confirmation logic (handled in fact layer)
• Critical for bone health preservation and fracture prevention
• Essential input for osteoporosis care quality improvement initiatives

/*
All osteoporosis diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF osteoporosis cluster ID:
- OSTEO_COD: Osteoporosis diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF osteoporosis register data collection
- Bone health assessment
- Osteoporosis diagnosis tracking

Key QOF Requirements:
- Register inclusion: Osteoporosis diagnosis (OSTEO_COD) OR DXA confirmation
- DXA confirmation handled via separate int_dxa_scans_all model
- Combined logic applied in fact layer

Note: DXA scans and T-scores are handled in separate int_dxa_scans_all model.
The register logic combines clinical diagnosis with DXA confirmation in the fact layer.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per osteoporosis observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_osteoporosis_register.sql which applies QOF business rules.
