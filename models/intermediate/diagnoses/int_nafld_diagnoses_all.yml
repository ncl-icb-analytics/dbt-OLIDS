  description: 'Intermediate: NAFLD Diagnoses All - Complete history of all Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease diagnosis observations from clinical records.


    Clinical Purpose:

    • NAFLD diagnosis tracking and liver health assessment

    • Metabolic syndrome monitoring and risk stratification

    • Potential QOF register development preparation

    • Integration with diabetes and obesity management pathways


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per NAFLD diagnosis observation

    • Includes all diagnosis dates for complete clinical history

    • Uses hardcoded SNOMED concepts (pending NAFLD_COD cluster availability)


    Key Features:

    • Progressive liver disease monitoring capability

    • Links to metabolic risk factors and comorbidities

    • Awaiting formal cluster implementation

    • Supports comprehensive liver health assessment'
