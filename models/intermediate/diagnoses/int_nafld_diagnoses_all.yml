  description: 'Intermediate: NAFLD Diagnoses - All Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease diagnosis observations from clinical records.


Clinical Purpose:

• NAFLD diagnosis tracking and liver health assessment

• Metabolic syndrome monitoring and risk stratification

• Integration with diabetes and obesity management pathways


Data Granularity:

• One row per NAFLD diagnosis observation

• Includes all patients with recorded NAFLD diagnoses

• Complete clinical history with all diagnosis dates

• Uses hardcoded SNOMED concepts (pending NAFLD_COD cluster availability)


Key Features:

• Progressive liver disease monitoring capability

• Links to metabolic risk factors and comorbidities

• Awaiting formal cluster implementation for complete coverage
• Supports comprehensive liver health assessment'
