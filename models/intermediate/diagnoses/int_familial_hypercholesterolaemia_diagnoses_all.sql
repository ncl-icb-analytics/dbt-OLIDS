Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ QOF FH register data collection and monitoring
â€¢ Genetic cardiovascular risk assessment for familial hypercholesterolaemia
â€¢ Family screening pathway identification and cascade testing
â€¢ Lipid management and statin therapy decision support

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per FH diagnosis observation
â€¢ Includes all diagnosis dates for complete clinical history
â€¢ Uses FHYP_COD cluster for QOF-compliant diagnosis identification

Key Features:
â€¢ Genetic condition tracking with no resolution codes
â€¢ Age restrictions (typically â‰¥20 years for QOF)
â€¢ Essential for family screening programmes
â€¢ Supports intensive cholesterol management protocols

/*
All familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Uses QOF familial hypercholesterolaemia cluster ID:
- FHYP_COD: Familial hypercholesterolaemia diagnoses

Clinical Purpose:
- QOF FH register data collection
- Familial hypercholesterolaemia monitoring
- Genetic cardiovascular risk assessment
- Family screening pathway identification

Key QOF Requirements:
- Register inclusion: FH diagnosis (FHYP_COD)
- No resolution codes - FH is a genetic condition
- Age restrictions apply (usually age â‰¥20 years for QOF)
- Important for statin therapy and family screening

Note: FH does not have resolved codes as it is a genetic cardiovascular condition.
The register tracks diagnosis for family screening and intensive cholesterol management.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per FH observation.
