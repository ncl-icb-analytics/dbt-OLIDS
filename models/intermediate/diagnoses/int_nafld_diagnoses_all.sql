Clinical Purpose:
‚Ä¢ NAFLD diagnosis tracking and liver health assessment
‚Ä¢ Metabolic syndrome monitoring and risk stratification
‚Ä¢ Potential QOF register development preparation
‚Ä¢ Integration with diabetes and obesity management pathways

Data Granularity:
‚Ä¢ One row per NAFLD diagnosis observation
‚Ä¢ Includes all diagnosis dates for complete clinical history
‚Ä¢ Uses hardcoded SNOMED concepts (pending NAFLD_COD cluster availability)

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Progressive liver disease monitoring capability
‚Ä¢ Links to metabolic risk factors and comorbidities
‚Ä¢ Awaiting formal cluster implementation
‚Ä¢ Supports comprehensive liver health assessment

/*
All Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) diagnosis observations from clinical records.
Currently uses hardcoded SNOMED concept codes as no cluster is available in REFERENCE.

‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Update with proper cluster ID once NAFLD_COD becomes available in REFERENCE.

Clinical Purpose:
- NAFLD diagnosis tracking
- Liver health assessment
- Potential QOF register development

Note: This should be updated to use get_observations() macro once proper cluster ID is available.

Includes ALL persons (active, inactive, deceased) following intermediate layer principles.
This is OBSERVATION-LEVEL data - one row per NAFLD observation.
Use this model as input for fct_person_nafld_register.sql which applies business rules.
