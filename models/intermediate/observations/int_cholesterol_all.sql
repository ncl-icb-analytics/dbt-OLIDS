Clinical Purpose:
â€¢ Tracks cholesterol measurements for cardiovascular risk assessment and management
â€¢ Supports lipid management programmes and statin therapy monitoring
â€¢ Enables cardiovascular disease prevention and QOF reporting

Data Granularity:
â€¢ One row per cholesterol observation
â€¢ Includes all patients regardless of status (active/inactive/deceased)
â€¢ Uses CHOL2_COD cluster for total cholesterol identification

Key Features:
â€¢ Data quality validation with plausible range filtering (0.5-20 mmol/L)
â€¢ Clinical cholesterol categorisation (desirable, borderline high, high)
â€¢ Original value preservation for audit and unit conversion
â€¢ Comprehensive observation metadata for traceability
