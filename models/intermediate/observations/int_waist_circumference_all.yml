    description: 'Intermediate: Waist Circumference Observations - All recorded waist circumference measurements with cardiovascular risk assessment.


      Clinical Purpose:

      • Tracks waist circumference for cardiovascular and metabolic risk assessment

      • Supports obesity management and metabolic syndrome screening

      • Enables abdominal obesity monitoring and health risk stratification


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per waist circumference observation

      • Includes all patients regardless of status (active/inactive/deceased)

      • Uses WAIST_COD cluster for waist circumference measurement identification


      Key Features:

      • Data quality validation with plausible range filtering (30-250 cm)

      • Clinical risk categorisation based on cardiovascular risk thresholds

      • High-risk and very high-risk indicators for clinical intervention

      • Comprehensive anthropometric assessment for metabolic health'
