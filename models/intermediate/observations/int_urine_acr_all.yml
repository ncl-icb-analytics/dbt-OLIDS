    description: 'Intermediate: Urine ACR Observations - All recorded albumin-to-creatinine ratio measurements for kidney function assessment.


      Clinical Purpose:

      • Tracks urine ACR levels for CKD diagnosis, staging and progression monitoring

      • Supports diabetic nephropathy screening and kidney disease management

      • Enables proteinuria assessment and cardiovascular risk stratification


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per ACR observation

      • Includes all patients regardless of status (active/inactive/deceased)

      • Uses UACR_TESTING cluster for ACR test result identification


      Key Features:

      • Data quality validation with plausible range filtering (0-1000 mg/mmol)

      • Clinical ACR categorisation (normal, mildly/moderately/severely increased)

      • Microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria classification

      • CKD risk indicators for clinical decision support'
