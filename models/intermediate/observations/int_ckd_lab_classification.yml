  description: 'Intermediate: CKD Lab Classification - Laboratory-based CKD staging and criteria assessment.


    Clinical Purpose:

    • Classifies CKD stage based on latest eGFR and ACR laboratory results

    • Supports CKD case finding and clinical audit processes

    • Enables identification of patients meeting CKD criteria regardless of diagnosis


    Data Granularity:

    • One row per person with comprehensive CKD laboratory assessment

    • Combines latest eGFR and ACR results with confirmation logic

    • Includes all patients with relevant laboratory data


    Key Features:

    • CKD staging using G-stage (G1-G5) and A-stage (A1-A3) classification

    • Persistent abnormal result confirmation (>90 days apart)

    • Combined inferred CKD stage and criteria assessment

    • Laboratory-based CKD identification for clinical decision support'
