  description: 'All unable-to-have-spirometry observations from clinical records.

    Uses QOF cluster ID UNABLESPI_COD for patients unable to perform spirometry tests.


    Clinical Purpose:

    - COPD register spirometry confirmation requirements (post-April 2023)

    - Alternative pathway for COPD register inclusion when spirometry cannot be performed

    - Documentation of contraindications or patient inability


    QOF Context:

    For COPD patients diagnosed after April 2023, spirometry confirmation is required for register inclusion.

    When spirometry cannot be performed due to patient contraindications or inability, this documentation

    serves as an alternative pathway for COPD register inclusion.


    Includes ALL persons following intermediate layer principles.

    Use as input for COPD register spirometry validation.
