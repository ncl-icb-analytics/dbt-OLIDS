    description: 'Intermediate: Fragility Fracture Observations - All recorded fragility fractures for osteoporosis monitoring.


      Clinical Purpose:

      • Tracks fragility fractures for QOF osteoporosis register data collection

      • Supports bone health monitoring and fracture pattern analysis

      • Enables osteoporosis risk assessment and clinical decision support


      Data Granularity:

      • One row per fracture observation

      • Includes fractures after April 2012 as per QOF requirements

      • Uses FF_COD cluster for fragility fracture identification


      Key Features:

      • Fracture site classification (hip, wrist, spine, humerus, pelvis, femur)

      • QOF-compliant date filtering for osteoporosis register eligibility

      • Clinical fracture coding validation and categorisation

      • Essential input for osteoporosis register and bone health analytics'
