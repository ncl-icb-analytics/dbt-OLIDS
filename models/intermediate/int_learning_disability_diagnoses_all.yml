      All learning disability diagnosis observations from clinical records using QOF cluster ID.
      Provides comprehensive data collection for learning disability register and special needs service planning.
      
      QOF Cluster IDs Used:
      - LD_DIAGNOSIS_COD: Learning disability diagnoses
      
      Clinical Purpose:
      - QOF learning disability register data collection (age ≥14)
      - Learning disability care pathway monitoring
      - Special needs service planning
      - Health equity monitoring
      
      Key QOF Requirements:
      - Register inclusion: Age ≥14 and presence of learning disability diagnosis (LD_DIAGNOSIS_COD)
      - No resolution codes - learning disability is considered permanent condition
      - Age threshold of 14 years for register inclusion
      - No upper age limit
      
      Note: Learning disability does not have resolved codes as it is considered a permanent condition.
      The register is based purely on the presence of diagnostic codes and age criteria.
      
      Includes ALL persons following intermediate layer principles.
      Use as input for fct_person_learning_disability_register.sql which applies QOF business rules and age filtering.
