# LTC/LCS Migration Plan

## Notes

- User created feature branch `feature/valproate-migration`.
- Focus on valproate legacy dynamic tables: `DIM_PROG_VALPROATE_ACTION_STATUS`, `DIM_PROG_VALPROATE_ARAF`, `DIM_PROG_VALPROATE_ARAF_REFERRAL`.
- Start from all dependencies for those tables located in the `legacy` folder.
- Build new dbt models using the project's conventions; refer to `README.md` and existing dbt models for patterns.
- Add brief but informative comments in every model.
- Provide accompanying `.yml` files with key tests (not null, unique, relationships).
- Located legacy file `legacy/dimensions/dim_prog_valproate_action_status.sql` for analysis.
- Located legacy files `legacy/dimensions/dim_prog_valproate_araf.sql` and `legacy/dimensions/dim_prog_valproate_araf_referral.sql` (ARAF and REFERRAL logic confirmed).
- Located additional dependency files: `dim_prog_valproate_db_scope.sql`, `dim_prog_valproate_ppp_status.sql`, `dim_prog_valproate_neurology.sql`, `dim_prog_valproate_psychiatry.sql`.
- `fct_clinical_safety_on_valproate_and_pregnant.sql` already migrated; exclude from scope.
- Identified dependencies for action status: `DIM_PROG_VALPROATE_DB_SCOPE`, `DIM_PROG_VALPROATE_PPP_STATUS`, `DIM_PROG_VALPROATE_ARAF`, `INTERMEDIATE_PERM_ABSENCE_PREG_RISK`, `FCT_PERSON_DX_LD`, `FCT_PERSON_PREGNANT`, `DIM_PROG_VALPROATE_NEUROLOGY`, `DIM_PROG_VALPROATE_PSYCHIATRY`.
- `dim_person_women_child_bearing_age` and `int_valproate_medications_6m_latest` already exist in dbt; prerequisites for DB_SCOPE model satisfied.
- Created new dbt model and schema YAML for `dim_prog_valproate_db_scope` under `models/intermediate/programme/valproate/`.
- Reviewed legacy PPP_STATUS logic file; ready to model in dbt.
- PPP_STATUS should include all PPP events, not limited to active patients; DB_SCOPE remains scoped to active patients.
- Initial PPP_STATUS dbt model and `.yml` created; active patient scoping removed.
- Compilation currently fails due to missing refs `intermediate_ppp_status_all` and `dim_person_surrogate_keys`; these supporting models/sources must be added or references updated.
- Created `intermediate_ppp_status_all` dbt model; PPP_STATUS now references it and no longer requires surrogate key join.
- Missing reference errors resolved; PPP_STATUS should now compile.
- Moved DB_SCOPE and PPP_STATUS models (and their YAML) to `models/marts/programme/valproate/` to align with dimensional layer conventions.
- Updated column names in PPP_STATUS model to match `int_ppp_status_all` output; ready for compilation validation.
- Intermediate PPP status model renamed to `int_ppp_status_all` and schema YAML added; PPP_STATUS references updated.
- Agreed to avoid `sk_patient_id` in ARAF model; will create `int_valproate_araf_events` intermediate and `dim_prog_valproate_araf` mart.
- Implemented `int_valproate_araf_events` intermediate model and YAML, and `dim_prog_valproate_araf` mart model and YAML.
- `dbt run` revealed Snowflake error: aggregate function `BOOL_OR` not supported; need to switch to `boolor_agg` (or similar) in ARAF model to compile.
- Replaced `BOOL_OR` with `boolor_agg`; ARAF model now compiles.
- Implemented `int_valproate_araf_referral_events` intermediate model and YAML, and `dim_prog_valproate_araf_referral` mart model and YAML.
- Began review of legacy neurology model; will create `int_valproate_neurology_events` intermediate and `dim_prog_valproate_neurology` mart (no surrogate key).
- Implemented `int_valproate_neurology_events` intermediate model and YAML, and `dim_prog_valproate_neurology` mart model and YAML.
- Implemented `int_valproate_psychiatry_events` intermediate model and YAML, and `dim_prog_valproate_psychiatry` mart model and YAML.
- Implemented `dim_prog_valproate_action_status` mart model and YAML, integrating all dependency marts.
- Fixed child-bearing age reference in ACTION_STATUS (now uses `is_child_bearing_age_0_55`).
- First compile attempt of ACTION_STATUS failed: missing column `has_recent_valproate_medication`; need to align with `dim_prog_valproate_db_scope` output.
- Replacement of reference attempted but compile still errors; ensure expression aliased or select list updated.
- Second compile attempt failed: missing column `is_pregnant`; need to source pregnancy status (e.g., from FCT_PERSON_PREGNANT) or adjust logic.
- Identified pregnancy status source table: `fct_person_pregnancy_status` (column `is_currently_pregnant`). Will join to ACTION_STATUS.
- Integrated `fct_person_pregnancy_status` into ACTION_STATUS and model now compiles successfully.
- Valproate migration PR merged to `main`; feature branch deleted.
- New feature branch `feature/ltc_lcs_migration` created for LTC/LCS programme migration.
- LTC/LCS programme will use separate intermediate models per entity, each prefixed `int_ltc_lcs_*`, with mart tables `dim_prog_ltc_lcs_*`.
- Will refer to `legacy_dbt_model_checklist.md` to mark valproate items complete and enumerate required LTC/LCS models.
- Plan refocused: valproate migration complete; now working on LTC/LCS branch `feature/ltc_lcs_migration`.
- We will NOT recreate the consolidated `ltc_lcs_raw_data` model; each entity will instead have its own `int_ltc_lcs_*` intermediate model.
- CF stands for case finding; all `CF_*` tables are case finding indicators used to prioritise patients in the LTC/LCS service.
- MOC refers to the care-planning arm (Year-of-Care); for now only `dim_prog_ltc_lcs_moc_base` will be migrated.
- Legacy consolidated raw data logic reviewed; we will not recreate it. Instead, for each clinical area (e.g. AF) we will build two granular intermediates: one for observations and one for medications (e.g. `int_ltc_lcs_af_observations`, `int_ltc_lcs_af_medications`). These will include all required clusters, filter `mapped_concepts` to `source = 'LTC_LCS'`, and leverage the cluster-id macro **along with the existing `get_observations` and `get_medication_orders` macros for data retrieval**.
- The existing `int_ltc_lcs_cf_af_61` model currently references the non-existent `int_ltc_lcs_raw_data`; it must be refactored to use the new per-area intermediates and drop the hard-coded `61` from its filename when we are happy with the structure.
- Implemented initial CF_AF_61 intermediate model and YAML (to be refactored)
- Implemented initial CF_AF_61 mart model and YAML (to be refactored)
- Created area-level intermediates `int_ltc_lcs_af_observations` and `int_ltc_lcs_af_medications`, leveraging macros; medication model simplified to single macro call; clusters now cover AF_61 and AF_62 measures
- Cluster ID validation YAML fixed: model-level `cluster_ids_exist` tests now correctly placed and compile.
- Located legacy base population logic file `legacy/intermediate/intermediate_ltc_lcs_cf_base_population.sql`; will recreate as `int_ltc_lcs_cf_base_population`.
- Created `int_ltc_lcs_cf_base_population` intermediate model and YAML (base population for case finding).
- Agreed to create case finding exclusions as `int_ltc_lcs_cf_exclusions` intermediate (not dimension).
- Created `int_ltc_lcs_cf_exclusions` intermediate model and YAML; base population updated to reference it.
- Created `int_ltc_lcs_cf_af_61` intermediate model and refactored `dim_prog_ltc_lcs_cf_af_61` mart to use new intermediates; health check integration pending.
- Compile attempt failed due to missing `fct_person_dx_diabetes`; will replace with existing `fct_person_diabetes_register` in exclusions model.
- Updated exclusions model to reference `fct_person_diabetes_register`; compilation advances but AF medications macro error encountered.
- Identified `get_medication_orders` supports only a single `cluster_id`; refactored AF medications model using multiple macro calls with `UNION ALL`.
- Current compilation fails due to trailing semicolon in `int_ltc_lcs_cf_exclusions.sql`; semicolon removed.
- Removed all `sk_patient_id` columns from CF_AF_61, exclusions, and related models per user request.
- After semicolon fix, new compile errors identified: (1) `int_ltc_lcs_af_medications` union of multiple `get_medication_orders` macro calls causes "mismatched input 'WITH'" due to repeated CTEs; requires refactor. (2) `int_ltc_lcs_cf_exclusions` references outdated diabetes register columns (`earliest_dmtype2_diagnosis_date`, `latest_dmtype2_diagnosis_date`) which should map to `earliest_type2_date`, `latest_type2_date`.
- Updated exclusions model: aligned diabetes register column names and removed `is_on_register` / `is_on_dm_register` filters.
- Wrapped AF medications macro calls inside a single CTE (`af_med_orders`) to avoid repeated WITH blocks; compilation still pending.
- Reviewed patterns in existing medication intermediates using `get_medication_orders`; will mirror this pattern (single macro call per subquery or uniquely aliased subqueries) to resolve duplicate WITH issue.
- Implemented cluster_id tagging in each SELECT of `int_ltc_lcs_af_medications`; model now compiles, resolving missing column error.
- User requested cleaner approach: modify `get_medication_orders` macro to accept multiple `cluster_id`s and expose `cluster_id` column, simplifying AF medications logic.
- Implemented cluster_id tagging in each SELECT of `int_ltc_lcs_af_medications`; model compiled.
- `get_medication_orders` macro refactored to single-query style: accepts multiple `cluster_id`s, returns `cluster_id`, no CTEs; `int_ltc_lcs_af_medications` simplified; AF_61 chain compiles successfully.
- User now requests adding a `source` filter (set to `LTC_LCS`) to `get_medication_orders`, mirroring `get_observations`.
- Added `source` filter to `get_medication_orders` macro (now aligns with `get_observations`), updated AF medications intermediate with `source='LTC_LCS'`, and models compile successfully.
- Removed `sk_patient_id` column and associated `not_null` tests from all LTC/LCS YAML files to resolve dbt generic test failures.
- Generic household `expression_is_true` test failures deferred for now; focus shifts to building remaining LTC/LCS models.
- Next priority: migrate AF_62 indicator models (missing pulse check)
- Implemented `int_ltc_lcs_cf_af_62` intermediate model and YAML.
- Implemented `dim_prog_ltc_lcs_cf_af_62` mart model and YAML.
- Build failed due to missing `fct_person_health_check` reference; update AF_62 model to use existing health check intermediate.

## Recent Progress

### ✅ CYP ASTHMA MODEL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED (Current Session)
**SUCCESS**: CYP asthma case finding model successfully implemented with proper medication/observation separation!

#### CYP Asthma Models Completed:
1. **CYP_AST_61** ✅ - Children and young people (18 months to under 18 years) with asthma symptoms but no formal diagnosis

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Proper Macro Usage**: Separated medications and observations using correct macros
  - `int_ltc_lcs_cyp_asthma_medications` - Uses `get_medication_orders` macro for asthma medications, prednisolone, montelukast
  - `int_ltc_lcs_cyp_asthma_observations` - Uses `get_observations` macro for suspected asthma, viral wheeze, asthma diagnosis/resolved
- **Business Logic**: 
  - Age filtering (18 months to under 18 years using `age_days_approx >= 547`)
  - Symptom detection (medications OR observations in last 12 months)
  - Diagnosis exclusion (patients with formal asthma diagnosis, excluding resolved asthma)
- **Column Name Fix**: Corrected `clinical_effective_date` to `order_date` for medication orders
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive YAML schemas with 6/6 tests passing

#### Models Successfully Built and Tested:
- **Supporting Models**: 
  - `int_ltc_lcs_cyp_asthma_medications` ✅ (materialized as table)
  - `int_ltc_lcs_cyp_asthma_observations` ✅ (materialized as table)
- **Case Finding Model**: `int_ltc_lcs_cf_cyp_ast_61` ✅ (ephemeral)

  - Hypertension indicators (HTN_61, HTN_62, HTN_63, HTN_65, HTN_66)
- **Boolean Flags**: Each indicator represented as a boolean flag (`in_af_61`, `in_ckd_61`, etc.)
- **Single View**: Provides unified view of all case finding indicators per person
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive YAML schema with 27/27 tests passing

#### Models Successfully Built and Tested:
- **Summary Model**: `dim_prog_ltc_lcs_cf_summary` ✅ (materialized as table with Snowflake comment)
- **Test Coverage**: 27 data quality tests covering all boolean flags and core columns
