# Preserved Models Configuration
# Models listed here will be preserved during the sources regeneration process
# These are staging models that have been manually modified and should not be overwritten

preserved_models:
  # Manually modified staging models
  - model: stg_olids_patient_person
    reason: "Manually modified to generate from PATIENT table instead of PATIENT_PERSON (issue #192)"
    source_table: PATIENT_PERSON  # Original source table that would normally generate this model
  
  - model: stg_olids_person
    reason: "Manually modified to use DISTINCT to handle duplicate person_id values (issue #192)"
    source_table: PERSON
  
  # Add more preserved models as needed
  # - model: stg_model_name
  #   reason: "Why this model is preserved"
  #   source_table: ORIGINAL_TABLE_NAME
